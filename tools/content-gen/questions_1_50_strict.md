## QUESTION 1: The "Gift" Flight

**Topic:** Pro-Rata Expense Sharing  
**Airports:** KOSH (Oshkosh), Madison, WI  
**Aircraft:** Rented Cessna 172

**Scenario:**  
You're planning a weekend trip to Oshkosh (OSH) for AirVenture in your rented Cessna 172. Your college roommate, who has no interest in aviation, mentions he'd love to visit Madison, Wisconsin (just 60 miles from Oshkosh) the same weekend to see family.

He offers to pay for "the entire plane rental and fuel as a thank-you gift" since "you're already going anyway." Your friend insists this is perfectly legal because he's paying "as a gift, not as payment for services." He even offers to Venmo you the money before the flight.

You wouldn't be flying to Madison at all if he weren't going - Oshkosh is your only destination.

**Question:** Can you accept his offer?

**MODEL ANSWER:**  
No. The maximum he can pay is his pro-rata share - 50% of the costs. I pay 50%, he pays 50%. Under 14 CFR 61.113, private pilots cannot accept compensation.

**Trap Reasoning:**  
"It's a gift, not compensation - gifts aren't covered by 14 CFR 61.113"

**Why Trap Fails:**  
The FAA doesn't care what you call the payment. If payment induces the flight, it's compensation.

**Why It Matters:**  
Payment is "inducement" if you wouldn't make the flight without it. Your destination is Oshkosh, not Madison - so his payment is directly causing a flight that wouldn't otherwise happen.

**Detailed Explanation:**  
The "common purpose" test from AC 61-142 requires that both the pilot and passenger have a bona fide purpose for going to the destination, independent of each other. Your friend is going to Madison to see family (legitimate purpose), but you have zero reason to go to Madison - your destination is Oshkosh. This fails the common purpose test.

Pro-rata share under 14 CFR 61.113(c) allows you to share only the direct operating expenses: fuel, oil, airport fees, and rental fees. He can pay half (his pro-rata share). You pay half. Anything beyond that is compensation.

**Cram Mode:** "Gift" or not - if payment induces the flight, it's compensation. Pro-rata only: split costs equally.

**Reference:** 14 CFR 61.113(a) & (c), AC 61-142

## QUESTION 2: Fuel-Only Split

**Topic:** Pro-Rata Expense Sharing  
**Airports:** KSAC (Sacramento) → KTVL (Lake Tahoe)  
**Aircraft:** Owned Cessna 182

**Scenario:**  
You're flying your personally-owned Cessna 182 from Sacramento (SAC) to Lake Tahoe (TVL) with two friends for a weekend ski trip. The three of you have been planning this for weeks, and you all have legitimate reasons to go - you're all skiing.

Your friends offer to split the costs, and one of them suggests: "Since you own the plane, how about we just split the fuel costs? You already pay for insurance and maintenance anyway, so we'll cover gas."

Your friend argues that this is fair because you'd be paying insurance and maintenance whether they come or not. The fuel is the only "incremental" cost of adding passengers. Total fuel cost is $120, so they each offer $40, and you pay $40. The flight would have cost you about $180 total (fuel + hourly engine reserve + tie-down fees).

**Question:** Can you accept this arrangement?

**MODEL ANSWER:**  
No, we can't split only fuel. Pro-rata under 14 CFR 61.113(c) includes fuel, oil, airport fees, and rental fees. For owned aircraft, rental fees means hourly engine and maintenance reserves. Total cost is $180, divided by three people - $60 each.

**Trap Reasoning:**  
"Fuel is the only incremental cost - insurance/maintenance are fixed costs I pay anyway"

**Why Trap Fails:**  
For owned aircraft, 'rental fees' means hourly operating costs - engine reserve, maintenance reserve, and direct airport fees.

**Why It Matters:**  
If you split only fuel, passengers pay $80 total while you pay $100. That's not equal sharing - you're subsidizing their portion, which the FAA prohibits.

**Detailed Explanation:**  
For owned aircraft, "rental fees" means the direct cost of operating the aircraft for that flight. This includes hourly engine reserve (saving for overhaul based on tach time), hourly maintenance reserve (oil changes, inspections prorated per hour), and direct airport costs (tie-down, transient parking).

Total flight cost = Fuel + Oil + Hourly engine reserve + Hourly mx reserve + Airport fees. Each person pays an equal share.

The FAA requires equal sharing to prevent private pilots from running quasi-commercial operations.

**Cram Mode:** Pro-rata includes fuel, oil, airport fees, AND hourly reserves - not just gas money.

**Reference:** 14 CFR 61.113(c), AC 61-142

## QUESTION 3: BasicMed to Canada

**Topic:** Medical Currency - BasicMed International Validity  
**Airports:** KBUF (Buffalo, NY) → CYTZ (Toronto, Canada)  
**Aircraft:** Cessna 172

**Scenario:**  
You're a 45-year-old private pilot with BasicMed privileges. Your third-class medical expired 3 years ago. You're planning a weekend trip from Buffalo, NY (KBUF) to Toronto, Canada (CYTZ) in a Cessna 172 with your spouse.

The aircraft weighs 2,450 lbs max gross, and you'll be flying VFR at 5,500 feet. You believe BasicMed is valid because you meet all the BasicMed requirements: aircraft under 6,000 lbs, fewer than 6 passengers, below 18,000 feet, and within U.S. regulations.

A pilot friend mentions, "BasicMed might not work for Canada," but you're not sure why.

**Question:** Can you make this flight?

**MODEL ANSWER:**  
Not with BasicMed alone. BasicMed is a U.S. privilege and foreign states may not recognize it. As of this bank’s update date (February 8, 2026), you should plan on Canada requiring an ICAO-compliant medical (e.g., an FAA third-class medical) for operations in Canadian airspace, and verify current Canadian acceptance before flight.

**Trap Reasoning:**  
"Canada and the U.S. have reciprocal agreements, so my U.S. BasicMed should be recognized"

**Why Trap Fails:**  
BasicMed is not ICAO-compliant. Canada requires ICAO medical certificates.

**Why It Matters:**  
Once you enter Canadian airspace, Canadian rules govern your flight. Even if you’re flying a U.S.-registered aircraft, you can’t assume a U.S.-only privilege will be accepted internationally.

**Detailed Explanation:**  
BasicMed is a U.S. privilege. Even though you're a U.S. pilot in a U.S.-registered aircraft, once you enter Canadian airspace you must comply with that country's rules, including medical requirements they recognize.

What you need for Canada: A valid FAA third-class medical (60 months if under 40, 24 months if 40+).

Common mistake: Pilots think "I'm departing from the U.S., so U.S. rules apply." Wrong. Once you enter foreign airspace, that country's rules govern your operation.

International note: acceptance can change. Don’t memorize a “country list” from memory—verify the specific country’s current policy before planning a cross-border flight.

**Cram Mode:** BasicMed is U.S.-only. For cross-border flying, verify whether the destination country accepts it; plan on needing an ICAO-compliant medical if they don’t.

**Reference:** 14 CFR 61.113(i), 61.23

## QUESTION 4: BasicMed Altitude Limit

**Topic:** Medical Currency - BasicMed Altitude Restrictions  
**Airports:** KAPA (Denver) → KASE (Aspen)  
**Aircraft:** Piper Saratoga (turbocharged)

**Scenario:**  
You're a private pilot with BasicMed flying a Piper Saratoga (turbocharged, service ceiling 20,000 feet) from Denver (KAPA) to Aspen (KASE). Due to mountainous terrain and weather, you plan to fly at 17,500 feet MSL for terrain clearance and favorable winds.

Your BasicMed exam was completed 2 months ago, and you're current on all requirements. Your passenger asks, "Do we need oxygen at that altitude?" You confirm yes - supplemental oxygen is required above 12,500 feet for extended periods.

Your passenger then asks, "Does your BasicMed work at this altitude, or do you need a regular medical for high-altitude flight?"

**Question:** Can you make this flight?

**MODEL ANSWER:**  
Yes. BasicMed is valid up to but not including 18,000 feet, so 17,500 is legal. I must use supplemental oxygen continuously above 14,000 feet, and passengers need oxygen available above 15,000 per 14 CFR 91.211.

**Trap Reasoning:**  
"High altitude requires a special medical - BasicMed is only for low-altitude recreational flying"

**Why Trap Fails:**  
BasicMed covers up to (but not including) 18,000 feet MSL. 17,500 is legal.

**Why It Matters:**  
BasicMed altitude limit is 18,000 feet MSL. At 17,500 feet, you're legal. Oxygen requirements are separate from medical requirements.

**Detailed Explanation:**  
BasicMed altitude limit is up to but not including 18,000 feet MSL. At 17,500 feet, you're within the BasicMed envelope.

Why 18,000 feet? That's where Class A airspace begins. Class A requires IFR flight, and BasicMed was designed for VFR operations in Class E/G airspace.

Oxygen requirements (14 CFR 91.211) are separate from medical requirements:
- Above 12,500 MSL for >30 minutes: Supplemental oxygen required for crew
- Above 14,000 MSL: Supplemental oxygen required continuously for crew
- Above 15,000 MSL: Oxygen must be available for passengers

This flight at 17,500 feet: Pilot must use oxygen continuously (above 14,000), passengers must have oxygen available (above 15,000), and BasicMed is valid (below 18,000).

**Cram Mode:** BasicMed valid up to (but not including) 18,000 feet. Use oxygen above 12,500+ per 91.211.

**Reference:** 14 CFR 61.113(i), 91.211, 91.135

## QUESTION 5: Medical Duration by Age

**Topic:** Medical Currency - Duration Calculation  
**Airports:** KAPA (Centennial) local  
**Aircraft:** Cessna 172

**Scenario:**  
You're a 38-year-old private pilot who obtained your third-class medical certificate on March 15, 2024. You're planning a flight on April 1, 2029 (just over 5 years later).

You believe your medical is still valid because you read online that third-class medicals are good for "5 years if you're under 40." Your flight will be a local VFR flight carrying one passenger.

A friend points out that you'll be 43 years old on the date of the flight, even though you were 38 when you got the medical. They say, "Your age on the date of the exam determines duration, not your current age." You're now confused.

**Question:** Is your medical still valid for this flight?

**MODEL ANSWER:**  
No, it expired. Under 14 CFR 61.23, duration is based on age at issuance. I was 38, so it's valid for 60 calendar months - expires March 31, 2029. April 1 is too late.

**Trap Reasoning:**  
"Since I'm 43 now, my medical is only good for 24 months from issue date"

**Why Trap Fails:**  
Duration is based on age at exam, not current age. You were 38 at exam = 60 months.

**Why It Matters:**  
Medical duration locks in based on your age when the exam was done. At 38, you got 60 months, period. Your current age doesn't matter.

**Detailed Explanation:**  
Medical certificate duration is based on your age on the date the medical was issued, not your current age.

The regulation (14 CFR 61.23(d)):
- Under 40 on exam date: 60 calendar months
- 40 or older on exam date: 24 calendar months

This scenario: Medical issued March 15, 2024 at age 38 = 60 calendar months = expires March 31, 2029 (last day of 60th month). Flight on April 1, 2029 is one day past expiration.

Calendar months vs. exact dates: Medical certificates expire at the end of the last day of the month, not on the exact anniversary. Exam on June 10, 2024 (age 35) = expires June 30, 2029.

Birthday timing matters: If your 40th birthday is before your exam → 24 months. If after your exam → 60 months.

**Cram Mode:** Medical duration based on age at exam, not current age. Under 40 at exam = 60 months; 40+ at exam = 24 months.

**Reference:** 14 CFR 61.23(d), 61.3(c)

**Link:** https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-D/part-61/subpart-A/section-61.23 | https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-D/part-61/subpart-A/section-61.3

## QUESTION 6: Special Issuance Deadlines

**Topic:** Medical Currency - SI Compliance  
**Airports:** KMYF (Montgomery-Gibbs Exec) local  
**Aircraft:** Cessna 172

**Scenario:**  
You're a private pilot who was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes two years ago. You applied for a third-class medical and received a Special Issuance (SI) medical certificate with a condition: "Valid for 12 months. Must provide updated HbA1c test results every 6 months to maintain authorization."

You received your SI on January 15, 2025. You submitted your 6-month HbA1c results on time in July 2025. Now it's January 25, 2026, and you want to fly but haven't submitted your next required follow-up yet.

You believe your medical is still valid because: (1) it was issued for 12 months (expires January 31, 2026), (2) you submitted the 6-month report on time, and (3) you have an appointment to get the 12-month HbA1c test next week.

Your plan: fly today, then submit the results in 10 days.

**Question:** Can you legally fly today?

**MODEL ANSWER:**  
No. Special Issuance privileges are conditional. If the Authorization for Special Issuance requires periodic test results to continue authorization, you can’t assume you’re authorized to act as PIC if you’re out of compliance with those conditions. The safe/legal approach is to stop flying and resolve it through your AME/FAA per the authorization letter.

**Trap Reasoning:**  
"I was only one day late - there must be a grace period for SI deadlines"

**Why Trap Fails:**  
Special Issuance authorization is conditional and depends on the terms of your authorization letter. You can’t invent a grace period or assume you’re authorized when you haven’t met the required conditions.

**Why It Matters:**  
Special Issuance is not “set it and forget it.” Your eligibility to act as PIC depends on complying with the conditions of the SI authorization. If you’re unsure, the correct answer is to ground yourself until the status is confirmed—not to fly and “catch up later.”

**Detailed Explanation:**  
This scenario’s timeline:
- SI issued: January 15, 2025  
- Condition: updated HbA1c results every 6 months to maintain authorization  
- 6-month report: submitted July 2025 ✓  
- Next report: due January 2026 (per the SI conditions) ✗  

SI authorizations often include ongoing conditions (“to maintain authorization…”). Those conditions are part of your eligibility. If you’re not meeting them, you should assume you’re not authorized until you comply and confirm your status per the authorization letter.

**Cram Mode:** Special Issuance is conditional. If the certificate is expired or SI conditions aren’t met, don’t fly—resolve it per the authorization letter/AME.

**Reference:** 14 CFR 61.23(c), 14 CFR 67.401, FAA AME Guide (Special Issuance)

## QUESTION 7: Seats vs. People

**Topic:** Pro-Rata Expense Sharing  
**Airports:** KSMO (Santa Monica) → KAVX (Catalina Island)  
**Aircraft:** Rented Cessna 172

**Scenario:**  
You're planning a weekend trip to Catalina Island (AVX) from Santa Monica (SMO) in a rented Cessna 172. Two friends ask to join you. Both have their own reasons for going to Catalina - one wants to hike, the other wants to visit the casino.

Total flight costs (rental + fuel) are $300. You suggest splitting it three ways: $100 each (pilot + two passengers = three people).

One of your passengers says, "Wait, shouldn't we split it four ways, not three? There are four seats in the plane, and you're using one of them. So it's $75 per seat, and you pay $75, we each pay $75." The other passenger agrees, saying this is more "fair" because you benefit from the plane too.

**Question:** What's the correct way to split the costs?

**MODEL ANSWER:**  
Three ways - $100 each. Pro-rata is based on people, not seats. Three people on board means we split costs three ways per 14 CFR 61.113(c).

**Trap Reasoning:**  
"Split by seats - there are 4 seats, so $75 per seat is fair and proportional"

**Why Trap Fails:**  
Empty seats don't create expenses. Split by people on board, not available seats.

**Why It Matters:**  
If you split by seats (4), you pay $75 while passengers pay $225 total - meaning passengers subsidize your flight. That's compensation.

**Detailed Explanation:**  
Pro-rata expense sharing is based on the number of occupants, not the number of available seats. The reasoning:

1. Empty seats don't create expenses. The plane costs $300 regardless of whether there are 2, 3, or 4 people aboard.
2. Each person pays an equal share of the actual costs. If there are 3 people, each pays 1/3. If there are 4 people, each pays 1/4.
3. The pilot is a participant, so the pilot pays a share too.

Example math:
- 3 people (1 pilot + 2 passengers): $300 ÷ 3 = $100 each
- 4 people (1 pilot + 3 passengers): $300 ÷ 4 = $75 each

The "seat-based" argument fails because it would allow the pilot to pay less than their fair share. If you split by seats (4), you pay $75, and passengers pay $225 total - meaning passengers are subsidizing your flight. This approaches compensation (you're paying less because others are aboard).

**Cram Mode:** Pro-rata = divide costs by number of people, not seats. Pilot is a person.

**Reference:** 14 CFR 61.113(c), AC 61-142

## QUESTION 8: "I Was Going Anyway"

**Topic:** Pro-Rata Expense Sharing  
**Airports:** KAPA (Denver) → KCNY (Moab, Utah)  
**Aircraft:** Rented aircraft

**Scenario:**  
You're a private pilot planning a solo cross-country flight from Denver (APA) to Moab, Utah (CNY) on Saturday to go hiking. You've already rented the plane and planned the route.

On Wednesday, a coworker mentions she needs to get to Moab the same weekend for a family event and was planning to drive (4+ hours). She asks if she can ride along and offers to "pay for the whole flight since you're going anyway."

Your coworker argues, "You were making this flight regardless of whether I come. I'm not creating any extra cost - you'd pay $400 either way. So if I pay the whole $400, you're not getting compensated - you're getting reimbursed for a flight you were already making."

**Question:** Can you accept her offer?

**MODEL ANSWER:**  
No. Maximum she can pay is 50% - her pro-rata share. I pay $200, she pays $200. No 'I was going anyway' exception under 14 CFR 61.113(c).

**Trap Reasoning:**  
"I was going anyway - she's just reimbursing me for a cost I already planned to incur"

**Why Trap Fails:**  
No 'I was going anyway' exception exists. Pro-rata rules apply regardless of who initiated the flight.

**Why It Matters:**  
If 'I was going anyway' allowed full reimbursement, pilots could pre-announce trips and collect full payment - effectively running unlicensed charter operations.

**Detailed Explanation:**  
The "I was going anyway" myth directly contradicts the regulation. The FAA completely rejects this logic.

Why the FAA doesn't allow this:

1. Slippery slope to charter operations. If "I was going anyway" allowed full reimbursement, pilots could pre-announce trips and collect full payment from passengers, effectively running an unlicensed charter service.

2. The regulation has no carve-outs. 14 CFR 61.113(c) simply states: "A private pilot may not pay less than the pro rata share of the operating expenses of a flight with passengers." It doesn't say "unless you were going anyway."

3. Intent doesn't matter - structure matters. Even if your intent is pure (you genuinely planned the trip), the structure of accepting 100% payment from a passenger is compensation.

**Cram Mode:** "I was going anyway" ≠ exception to pro-rata. Pay your share, they pay theirs.

**Reference:** 14 CFR 61.113(c), AC 61-142

## QUESTION 9: Goodwill Payments

**Topic:** Pro-Rata Expense Sharing  
**Airports:** Phoenix → Sedona  
**Aircraft:** Private aircraft

**Scenario:**  
You're a private pilot and real estate agent in Phoenix. A wealthy client mentions he's looking to buy a vacation property in Sedona and asks if you'd be willing to fly him up there to view some listings.

He offers to pay for the entire flight, plus $500 "for your time and expertise as a pilot." You'd be acting as his real estate agent during the property viewings, which is your actual job.

Your client argues this is legal because: (1) the real estate commission you earn from the sale is payment for real estate services, not pilot services, and (2) the $500 is "goodwill" for helping him out with transportation, not payment for being a pilot. He insists you're wearing your "real estate agent hat," not your "pilot hat."

**Question:** Can you accept this arrangement?

**MODEL ANSWER:**  
No. He can pay his pro-rata share only - 50% of flight costs. The $500 is compensation for pilot services and is prohibited under 14 CFR 61.113. Multiple business relationships don't create exceptions.

**Trap Reasoning:**  
"I'm his real estate agent first - the $500 is goodwill for real estate services, not pilot services"

**Why Trap Fails:**  
Any payment tied to the flight is compensation for pilot services, regardless of other business relationships.

**Why It Matters:**  
Multiple roles don't create loopholes. The Mangiamele Letter (2009) addressed this exact scenario - attorney flying clients. Answer: No.

**Detailed Explanation:**  
The Mangiamele Letter (2009) addressed nearly this exact scenario. An attorney wanted to fly clients to property viewings and argued the legal fees (not flight fees) were the real compensation. The FAA said no - any payment tied to the flight, regardless of business relationship, is compensation for pilot services.

Key principles:

1. Multiple roles don't create loopholes. Being a real estate agent doesn't exempt you from private pilot limitations.

2. "Goodwill" payments tied to flights are compensation. If the $500 is "for your time as a pilot," it's compensation. If it's "for being a great real estate agent" and happens after the sale closes, unrelated to the flight, it might be okay - but the timing and connection matter.

3. The flight must be incidental to business, not the reason for business.

**Cram Mode:** Goodwill payments tied to flights = compensation. Other business relationships don't exempt you from pro-rata.

**Reference:** 14 CFR 61.113(a), Mangiamele Letter (2009), AC 61-142

## QUESTION 10: Multi-Leg Recalculation

**Topic:** Pro-Rata Expense Sharing  
**Airports:** KMDW (Chicago) → KBNA (Nashville) → KTMB (Miami) → KEYW (Key West)  
**Aircraft:** Private aircraft

**Scenario:**  
You're planning a week-long trip from Chicago (KMDW) to Key West (KEYW) with two friends, stopping overnight in Nashville (KBNA) and Miami (KTMB). The three of you will fly down together, spend 5 days in Key West, then fly back together.

Total costs for the round trip: $2,400. You agree to split it three ways: $800 each.

On day 3 in Key West, one of your friends gets an emergency call - his mother is in the hospital. He books a commercial flight home immediately and won't be on the return trip.

He says, "I already paid my $800, so we're square, right? You and the other friend can fly back, and since I paid my share upfront, we're good." You now have two people for the return flight instead of three.

**Question:** Does he still owe $800, or do you need to recalculate?

**MODEL ANSWER:**  
We need to recalculate. Pro-rata applies per-leg under 14 CFR 61.113(c). He only flew outbound, so he owes his share of outbound costs only. The return flight is split between two people. He gets a partial refund.

**Trap Reasoning:**  
"We agreed to split upfront - a deal is a deal. He paid for his seat, emergency or not"

**Why Trap Fails:**  
Pro-rata applies per-flight, not per-trip. Can't charge someone for a flight they're not on.

**Why It Matters:**  
You cannot accept money from someone who isn't on the aircraft. If he paid $800 but only flew outbound legs, you owe him a partial refund.

**Detailed Explanation:**  
Pro-rata expense sharing applies per-flight, not per-trip. You cannot accept money from someone who isn't on the aircraft.

How to properly calculate this trip:

Assume costs:
- Outbound legs (KMDW → KEYW via 3 stops): $1,000
- Return (KEYW → KMDW direct): $1,400
- Total: $2,400

Correct split:

Outbound (3 people): $1,000 ÷ 3 = $333.33 each
Return (2 people only): $1,400 ÷ 2 = $700 each

Who pays what:
- Pilot: $333.33 (outbound) + $700 (return) = $1,033.33
- Friend who stayed: $333.33 (outbound) + $700 (return) = $1,033.33
- Friend who left early: $333.33 (outbound only)

Friend who left should get refund: Paid upfront $800, actually owes $333.33, refund due: $466.67.

**Cram Mode:** Pro-rata is per-leg, not per-trip. Can't charge for legs someone didn't fly - refund required.

**Reference:** 14 CFR 61.113(c), AC 61-142

# Questions 11-15: Night Currency
**Topic:** Night Currency & Passenger Requirements  
**Created:** February 7, 2026

## QUESTION 11: Night Currency Expires Mid-Flight

**Topic:** Night Currency - Timing of Requirements  
**Airports:** KSDL (Scottsdale) → KGCN (Grand Canyon)  
**Aircraft:** Cessna 172

**Scenario:**  
You're planning an evening flight from Scottsdale (KSDL) to Grand Canyon (KGCN) with your spouse as a passenger. The flight will take approximately 90 minutes. Today is March 15, and sunset is at 6:47 PM.

You plan to depart at 7:30 PM (43 minutes after sunset). Your last three night landings were on December 14, exactly 91 days ago. You completed three full-stop landings that night between 7:00 PM and 8:00 PM to get night current.

You figure you're legal to depart because you're departing within the 90-day window (today is day 91). Your spouse asks, "Are we legal for this flight?"

**Question:** Can you make this flight with your spouse?

**MODEL ANSWER:**  
No. Night starts one hour after sunset (7:47 PM). My currency expired at midnight last night (day 91). Even though we depart before "night" officially begins at 7:47 PM, we'll be in flight during the night period, and I'm not current to carry passengers after 7:47 PM.

**Trap Reasoning:**  
"We depart at 7:30 PM, which is before night begins at 7:47 PM, so we're legal"

**Why Trap Fails:**  
Night currency must be valid for the entire duration of the flight, not just at departure. You'll be flying past 7:47 PM with a passenger while not night current.

**Why It Matters:**  
Currency requirements must be met for the entire flight. If any portion of your flight occurs during the "night" period (1 hour after sunset to 1 hour before sunrise), you must be night current to carry passengers.

**Detailed Explanation:**  
Night is defined in 14 CFR 1.1 as the period beginning one hour after sunset and ending one hour before sunrise. For passenger currency purposes under 14 CFR 61.57(b), you need three takeoffs and landings to a full stop during this period within the preceding 90 days.

Timeline breakdown:
- Last night landings: December 14 (day 1 of 90-day window)
- 90th day: March 14
- Currency expires: End of day, March 14 (midnight)
- Today: March 15 (day 91 - NOT current)
- Sunset today: 6:47 PM
- Night begins: 7:47 PM (one hour after sunset)
- Planned departure: 7:30 PM

Even though you depart at 7:30 PM (before "night" officially begins), your flight will extend past 7:47 PM. Once 7:47 PM hits, you're flying with a passenger during the night period while not night current - that's illegal.

The regulation requires currency for carrying passengers at night. It doesn't matter that you departed before night began - what matters is that you're carrying a passenger during a portion of the flight that occurs at night.

Could you make this flight solo? Yes - night currency only applies to carrying passengers. Solo flight has no currency requirements beyond being a certificated pilot.

**Cram Mode:**  
Night currency must be valid for entire flight, not just departure. Night starts 1 hour after sunset. 90 days means through day 90, not day 91.

## QUESTION 12: Night Definition Confusion

**Topic:** Night Currency - Definition of Night  
**Airports:** KBFI (Seattle) → KORS (Orcas Island)  
**Aircraft:** Cessna 182

**Scenario:**  
You're a private pilot planning a flight from Seattle (KBFI) to Orcas Island (KORS) with two passengers. It's late September, and sunset is at 6:52 PM. You plan to depart at 7:20 PM (28 minutes after sunset) and land at Orcas at 8:10 PM.

Your last night currency flight was on June 25 (80 days ago), where you did three touch-and-goes between 7:30 PM and 8:00 PM - about 20 minutes after sunset.

You believe you're current because you logged those landings as "night" (they occurred after sunset), and it's been less than 90 days. Your passenger, who's also a pilot, says, "I don't think touch-and-goes 20 minutes after sunset count for night currency."

**Question:** Are you night current to carry these passengers?

**MODEL ANSWER:**  
No. Night passenger currency requires three full-stop landings during the period **1 hour after sunset to 1 hour before sunrise**. My landings on June 25 were only ~20–50 minutes after sunset (and they were touch-and-goes), so they don’t count. I’m not night current to carry passengers for this flight.

**Trap Reasoning:**  
"Night starts at sunset, so landings after sunset count for night currency"

**Why Trap Fails:**  
For logging purposes, night starts at sunset. For night currency purposes, night starts one hour after sunset. Different definitions.

**Why It Matters:**  
The FAA uses different definitions of "night" for different purposes. Logging time vs. passenger currency have different sunset-based thresholds.

**Detailed Explanation:**  
The FAA uses multiple “night” definitions depending on what you’re talking about:

1. **Position lights (14 CFR 91.209):** Required from **sunset to sunrise**.

2. **Logging night time (14 CFR 1.1):** Night is from the **end of evening civil twilight** to the **beginning of morning civil twilight** (published times vary by location/date).

3. **Night passenger currency (14 CFR 61.57(b)):** Specifically defined as **1 hour after sunset to 1 hour before sunrise**, and it requires **full-stop** landings.

Your June 25 landings:
- Sunset: ~7:10 PM
- Your landings: 7:30 PM - 8:00 PM (20-50 minutes after sunset)
- Night currency period: Starts 8:10 PM (one hour after sunset)
- Verdict: Your landings occurred BEFORE the night currency period began - they don't count.

Additionally, touch-and-goes don't count for night currency - only full-stop landings. You needed three full-stop landings between 8:10 PM and sunrise.

Why two definitions? Logging night time is about tracking experience. Night currency is about demonstrating recent proficiency in more challenging conditions (full darkness, not just dusk).

What you need to do: Complete three full-stop landings between 7:52 PM (one hour after today's sunset) and sunrise within the last 90 days before carrying passengers at night.

**Cram Mode:**  
Three “night” definitions: lights = sunset; logging = end of civil twilight; passenger currency = 1 hour after sunset (full-stop landings only).

**Reference:** 14 CFR 61.57(b), 14 CFR 1.1

## QUESTION 13: Solo vs. Passenger Night Currency

**Topic:** Night Currency - Solo Flight Exception  
**Airports:** KDPA (Chicago West) → KARR (Aurora)  
**Aircraft:** Cessna 152

**Scenario:**  
You're a private pilot who hasn't flown at night in 6 months. Your night currency expired months ago. You want to get night current again by flying solo from DuPage (KDPA) to Aurora (KARR) and doing three full-stop landings in the pattern at Aurora.

It's winter, and sunset is at 4:38 PM. You plan to depart at 6:00 PM (82 minutes after sunset) and do your three landings between 6:15 PM and 6:45 PM. All landings will be full-stop, and you'll be flying solo (no passengers).

Your CFI mentions, "Make sure you're night current before you fly at night." You respond, "I thought I could fly solo to GET night current?"

**Question:** Can you make this solo flight to regain night currency?

**MODEL ANSWER:**  
Yes. Night currency under 14 CFR 61.57(b) only applies to carrying passengers. Solo flight at night has no specific currency requirement beyond being a certificated pilot with a current medical.

**Trap Reasoning:**  
"You need to be night current to fly at night, period - even solo"

**Why Trap Fails:**  
Night currency is a passenger-carrying restriction, not a flight restriction. Solo night flight is legal for certificated pilots.

**Why It Matters:**  
Night currency creates a Catch-22 if you can't fly solo - you'd need to be current to get current. The FAA allows solo night flight specifically so pilots can regain currency.

**Detailed Explanation:**  
The regulation 14 CFR 61.57(b) states: "No person may act as pilot in command of an aircraft carrying passengers during the period beginning 1 hour after sunset and ending 1 hour before sunrise, unless within the preceding 90 days that person has made at least three takeoffs and three landings to a full stop..."

Key word: "carrying passengers."

This means:
- Night currency is required to carry passengers at night
- Night currency is NOT required to fly solo at night
- You can fly solo at night to regain your night currency

The logic: Night currency proves you're proficient at night operations. You regain that proficiency by practicing solo. Once you demonstrate proficiency (three landings), you can carry passengers again.

Without this solo exception, you'd have a Catch-22: You need to be current to fly at night, but you need to fly at night to become current. The solo exception solves this.

Your plan is completely legal:
- You're a certificated private pilot
- You have a current medical
- You're flying solo (no passengers)
- You plan to do three full-stop landings during the night period (after 5:38 PM, one hour after sunset)
- Once you complete those three landings, you're night current for 90 days and can carry passengers

Note: Some aircraft insurance policies require night currency even for solo flight. Check your insurance, especially if renting.

**Cram Mode:**  
Night currency only applies to carrying passengers. Solo flight at night is legal - that's how you regain currency.

## QUESTION 14: Required Equipment for Night VFR

**Topic:** Night Currency - Required Equipment  
**Airports:** KVNY (Van Nuys) → KSBA (Santa Barbara)  
**Aircraft:** Cessna 172

**Scenario:**  
You're planning a night VFR flight from Van Nuys (KVNY) to Santa Barbara (KSBA) with a passenger. You're night current (three landings last week). Sunset is at 5:42 PM, and you plan to depart at 7:00 PM.

During preflight, you notice the landing light is inoperative. The position lights (nav lights) work fine, the anti-collision beacon works, and all instruments are operational. The plane has no equipment list (no MEL), so you check 91.205.

Your passenger asks, "Can we still go? The runway has lights, and we have nav lights and the beacon." You remember that 91.205 requires specific equipment for night flight, but you're not sure if the landing light is required.

**Question:** Can you legally depart on this night VFR flight?

**MODEL ANSWER:**  
No. For night VFR, 14 CFR 91.205(c) requires position lights, anti-collision light, and if operated for hire, a landing light. However, 91.205(b) requires an inoperative equipment placard for any inoperative instrument or equipment. Without an MEL, I can't fly with inop equipment.

**Trap Reasoning:**  
"Landing lights are only required if operating for hire - I'm not for hire, so I can go"

**Why Trap Fails:**  
Even if landing light isn't required for your operation, 91.205(b) requires that ALL instruments and equipment installed must be operative unless covered by an MEL. Inoperative equipment grounds you.

**Why It Matters:**  
Just because equipment isn't required doesn't mean it can be broken. If it's installed, it must work OR be properly placarded/deactivated per MEL.

**Detailed Explanation:**  
This question has two parts: (1) Is the equipment required? (2) Can you fly with it inoperative?

Part 1 - Required equipment for night VFR per 14 CFR 91.205(c):
- Position lights (navigation lights) - REQUIRED
- Anti-collision light system - REQUIRED  
- Landing light, if operated for hire - REQUIRED only for hire operations

Since you're not operating for hire (private flight), the landing light is technically not required by 91.205(c).

Part 2 - Inoperative equipment rules per 14 CFR 91.205(b):
Even though the landing light isn't required for this flight, 91.205(b) states: "No person may operate a civil aircraft with inoperative instruments or equipment installed UNLESS" certain conditions are met (essentially, you need an MEL or the equipment must be removed/placarded).

Your options:
1. Get the landing light repaired
2. Placard it INOP and deactivate it (pull circuit breaker/disconnect) if not required and not on the "forbidden" list in 91.213(d)
3. Don't fly until fixed

Since your plane has no MEL, and you haven't placarded/deactivated the landing light, you're not legal to depart with it inoperative - even though it's not technically required for this type of operation.

The broader principle: If it's installed, it must work OR be properly documented as inoperative per 91.213. You can't just ignore broken equipment because "I don't need it anyway."

**Cram Mode:**  
Night VFR requires position lights and anti-collision light (landing light only for hire). But all installed equipment must be operative OR placarded inop per 91.213 if not required.

**Reference:** 14 CFR 91.205(b)(c), 14 CFR 91.213

## QUESTION 15: Student Pilot Night Restrictions

**Topic:** Night Currency - Student Pilot Limitations  
**Airports:** KSDM (San Diego) → KMYF (Montgomery Field)  
**Aircraft:** Cessna 172

**Scenario:**  
You're a student pilot working toward your private certificate. You've completed your night training with your CFI - you have 5 hours of night flight time, including 10 night takeoffs and landings at a towered airport (KSDM). Your CFI endorsed your logbook for night flight.

It's been 3 weeks since your last night lesson. Tonight you want to fly solo at night from San Diego (KSDM) to Montgomery Field (KMYF) - about 15 miles away - to practice night landings and build time toward your 10 required night takeoffs/landings. Sunset was at 6:15 PM, and you plan to depart at 7:30 PM (75 minutes after sunset).

Your CFI is not available tonight, but you have the required solo endorsement in your logbook from 2 months ago. You figure since you're endorsed for solo and endorsed for night, you're good to go.

**Question:** Can you make this flight?

**MODEL ANSWER:**  
No. Student pilots cannot carry passengers at night, but more importantly, I need a specific endorsement from my CFI within the preceding 90 days for each solo cross-country flight. A general solo endorsement isn't sufficient. Night solo requires careful CFI oversight.

**Trap Reasoning:**  
"I have a solo endorsement and night training - I can fly solo at night"

**Why Trap Fails:**  
Student pilots need specific endorsements for different types of solo flight. Night solo cross-country requires a recent, specific CFI endorsement per 14 CFR 61.87 and 61.93.

**Why It Matters:**  
Student pilot privileges are heavily restricted. Each solo flight outside the pattern requires specific CFI authorization, especially at night when risks are higher.

**Detailed Explanation:**  
Student pilot solo privileges are governed by 14 CFR 61.87 (solo in traffic pattern) and 61.93 (solo cross-country). Here's what you need:

For solo in the traffic pattern:
- Pre-solo written test completed
- Solo endorsement from CFI (valid until next flight review equivalent)
- CFI believes you're proficient

For solo cross-country (leaving the traffic pattern):
- Cross-country endorsement from CFI within preceding 90 days for the specific route or area
- CFI has reviewed your planning and believes you're prepared for that specific flight

For night operations as a student:
- While you can log night training with your CFI, solo night flight is generally allowed but requires extra caution
- Each solo cross-country at night should have a specific endorsement from your CFI
- Some CFIs won't endorse student night solo cross-countries due to the increased risk

Your situation:
- You have a general solo endorsement (2 months old)
- You want to fly from KSDM to KMYF (cross-country - leaving your home airport)
- You need a specific cross-country endorsement from your CFI within 90 days for this route
- Your CFI is not available to provide that endorsement tonight

Even if this were daytime, you'd need a fresh cross-country endorsement. At night, the need for specific CFI oversight is even more important.

What should you do:
1. Contact your CFI and discuss this specific flight
2. Get a specific endorsement for this night cross-country route if your CFI approves
3. If your CFI isn't available, don't fly - wait until you can get proper authorization

Student pilots operate under strict CFI supervision. Each solo flight that leaves the pattern requires fresh CFI approval and endorsement.

**Cram Mode:**  
Student pilots need specific CFI endorsement for each solo cross-country flight within 90 days. Night solo requires extra CFI oversight.

**Reference:** 14 CFR 61.87, 14 CFR 61.93

## QUESTION 16: Night Vision Adaptation

**Topic:** Night Currency - Physiological Factors  
**Airports:** KAPA (Denver) local pattern  
**Aircraft:** Cessna 172

**Scenario:**  
You're planning to get night current tonight by doing three full-stop landings in the pattern at Centennial Airport (KAPA). Sunset is at 6:15 PM, so you plan to arrive at 7:30 PM (75 minutes after sunset) when it's fully dark.

You've been inside a brightly-lit FBO for the past hour doing flight planning under fluorescent lights. Your eyes feel fine. You walk out to the aircraft at 7:25 PM, do a quick preflight with your flashlight, and plan to take off at 7:35 PM.

Your CFI calls and says, "Did you give your eyes time to adapt to the dark?" You respond, "I've got a flashlight - I can see fine."

**Question:** Should you delay your departure?

**MODEL ANSWER:**  
Yes. I should wait at least 30 minutes in dim light for my eyes to fully adapt to darkness. The AIM recommends this for safe night operations. I'll wait 20 more minutes before departing.

**Trap Reasoning:**  
"I have a flashlight and the cockpit is lit - I don't need dark adaptation"

**Why This Matters:**  
Your eyes use rod cells for night vision, which need 30 minutes in darkness to fully adapt. Without proper adaptation, you can't see dimly lit obstacles, unlighted terrain, or other aircraft at night. The AIM recommends avoiding bright white lights for 30 minutes before flight and using red cockpit lights to preserve night vision. You've been under fluorescent lights until 10 minutes ago - you need 20 more minutes of darkness before it's safe to fly.

**Cram Mode:**  
30 minutes for night vision adaptation. Avoid bright white light before night flight. Use red cockpit lights.

## QUESTION 17: Missing ARROW Document

**Topic:** Documents Required - ARROW  
**Airports:** KSDL (Scottsdale) local  
**Aircraft:** Cessna 172

**Scenario:**  
You're about to take a passenger on a sightseeing flight in a rented Cessna 172. During preflight, you check the aircraft documents:

- Airworthiness Certificate: Present and valid
- Registration: Present, but expired 4 months ago
- Radio Station License: Not present (domestic flight only)
- Operating Limitations (POH): Present
- Weight & Balance: Present and current

The FBO manager says, "The registration renewal is in process - we submitted it to the FAA 5 months ago. You're fine to fly while it's being processed."

**Question:** Can you make this flight?

**MODEL ANSWER:**  
No. The registration expired 4 months ago. Under 14 CFR 91.203, I need a current registration or temporary certificate. "In process" doesn't count - the aircraft isn't airworthy.

**Trap Reasoning:**  
"Registration renewals take forever - you can fly while it's in process with the FAA"

**Why This Matters:**  
Aircraft registration must be current at all times per 14 CFR 91.203. Registration expires every 3 years, and when you renew, you receive a temporary certificate valid for 120 days while the permanent one is processed. This aircraft has an expired registration with no temporary certificate visible - either the renewal wasn't properly submitted or the temp cert is missing from the aircraft. Either way, the aircraft is not airworthy and cannot be flown.

**Cram Mode:**  
ARROW required. Registration expires every 3 years. No current registration or temp cert = grounded.

**Reference:** 14 CFR 91.203, 14 CFR 47.40

## QUESTION 18: Pilot Certificate Left at Home

**Topic:** Documents Required - Personal Documents  
**Airports:** KBJC (Rocky Mountain Metro) → KGXY (Greeley)  
**Aircraft:** Cessna 172

**Scenario:**  
You arrive at the airport for a solo cross-country from Rocky Mountain Metro (KBJC) to Greeley (KGXY). During preflight, you realize your pilot certificate is at home in your other wallet. You have your medical certificate and driver's license.

You live 45 minutes away. Your friend suggests, "Just take a photo of your certificate and show it on your phone. Same information." Your digital pilot certificate is available on the FlyQ app.

The flight school says, "We need to see the physical cert before renting, but once airborne, nobody's going to check."

**Question:** Can you make this flight?

**MODEL ANSWER:**  
No. Under 14 CFR 61.3, I must have my physical pilot certificate in my possession while acting as PIC. Digital copies and photos don't count. I need to go home and get it.

**Trap Reasoning:**  
"Digital pilot certificates on apps are official - they count as having your certificate"

**Why This Matters:**  
14 CFR 61.3 requires three physical documents when acting as PIC: pilot certificate, medical certificate, and government-issued photo ID. The regulation states these must be "in that person's physical possession or readily accessible in the aircraft." Digital pilot certificates exist in apps, but they are not legally valid substitutes for the physical card. The FAA requires physical documents for enforcement and verification purposes. You must go home and get your physical certificate before flying.

**Cram Mode:**  
PPM: Pilot certificate, Photo ID, Medical - all must be PHYSICAL documents in possession. Digital doesn't count.

**Reference:** 14 CFR 61.3

## QUESTION 19: Digital vs Physical Documents

**Topic:** Documents Required - Photo ID  
**Airports:** KTUS (Tucson) → KPHX (Phoenix)  
**Aircraft:** Cessna 172

**Scenario:**  
You're planning a flight from Tucson (KTUS) to Phoenix (KPHX) with two passengers. During preflight, you verify you have your pilot certificate and medical certificate (both physical cards).

For your photo ID, you pull up your Arizona driver's license on your phone using the state's official AZ MVD Now app. Arizona issues official digital driver's licenses that are legally valid for TSA screening and traffic stops within the state.

Your passenger asks, "Is a digital driver's license okay for flying?" The app shows your photo, name, date of birth, and has a barcode for verification.

**Question:** Can you make this flight using your digital driver's license as your photo ID?

**MODEL ANSWER:**  
14 CFR 61.3 requires a government-issued photo identification to act as PIC. The regulation doesn’t explicitly spell out “physical vs. digital,” so I would not rely on a phone-only ID for compliance. I would bring a physical government-issued photo ID (driver’s license or passport). If I only had the digital ID, I would delay the flight until I had an ID that I’m confident will be accepted for FAA compliance and verification.

**Trap Reasoning:**  
"Arizona's digital driver's license is state-issued and legally valid - it counts as government ID"

**Why This Matters:**  
This is a strict-compliance mindset question. 14 CFR 61.3 requires you to have a government-issued photo ID available for inspection while acting as PIC. Because the regulation doesn’t clearly define whether a state-issued “mobile driver’s license” satisfies that requirement, relying on phone-only ID creates avoidable compliance risk. The clean, defensible answer is to carry a physical ID.

**Cram Mode:**  
Photo ID must be physical even if your state issues digital licenses. FAA hasn't approved digital IDs yet.

**Reference:** 14 CFR 61.3

## QUESTION 20: Expired Medical Discovered During Preflight

**Topic:** Documents Required - Medical Expiration  
**Airports:** KSNA (Orange County) → KSAN (San Diego)  
**Aircraft:** Cessna 172

**Scenario:**  
You're doing preflight for a flight from Orange County (KSNA) to San Diego (KSAN) with a passenger. While checking documents, you notice your medical certificate says "Expires: 01/2026" and today is February 7, 2026.

You're 44 years old. Your third-class medical exam was done when you were 42, so it's valid for 24 months. You have a BasicMed exam scheduled next week. The flight is only 45 minutes, and your passenger is already in the plane.

Your friend says, "You were legal last month - close enough."

**Question:** Can you make this flight?

**MODEL ANSWER:**  
No. My medical expired on January 31, 2026. Today is February 7 - I'm a week past expiration. Under 14 CFR 61.3, I cannot act as PIC without a valid medical or BasicMed. I need to cancel.

**Trap Reasoning:**  
"Medical certificates expire on the anniversary date, not end of month"

**Why This Matters:**  
Medical certificates display expiration as month/year (e.g., "01/2026"), not a specific day, and they expire on the last day of that month - in this case, January 31, 2026. The duration (24 or 60 calendar months) is based on your age at the exam date, not your current age. Since you were 42 at exam (40 or older = 24 months), your medical expired on the last day of the 24th month. Today (February 7) is past expiration, so you cannot fly until you complete your BasicMed exam or get a new FAA medical.

**Cram Mode:**  
Medical expires last day of month shown on certificate. Check month/year, not specific anniversary date.

**Reference:** 14 CFR 61.23, 14 CFR 61.3

## QUESTION 21: Inoperative Equipment - The Compass

**Topic:** Inoperative Equipment - VFR Day Required Equipment  
**Airports:** KFXE (Fort Lauderdale) local  
**Aircraft:** Cessna 152

**Scenario:**  
You're planning a local VFR day flight in the pattern at Fort Lauderdale Executive (KFXE). During preflight, the magnetic compass is stuck - the card isn't rotating freely and appears frozen pointing northeast.

The plane has a heading indicator (vacuum-powered) that works fine. You plan to fly VFR in the pattern, staying in sight of the runway. The plane has no MEL.

Your instructor says, "You've got a heading indicator - the compass is just backup. You're only going around the pattern."

**Question:** Can you make this flight?

**MODEL ANSWER:**  
No. Under 14 CFR 91.205(b), a magnetic compass is required for VFR day flight. Even though I have a heading indicator and I'm staying in the pattern, the compass must be operative or properly placarded inop per 91.213.

**Trap Reasoning:**  
"The heading indicator works and I'm staying in the pattern - I don't need the compass"

**Why This Matters:**  
The magnetic compass is required VFR day equipment per 14 CFR 91.205(b) - it's the "C" in ATOMATOFLAMES. The heading indicator is gyroscopic and precesses over time, requiring the compass to reset it periodically. The compass is also your backup if the vacuum system fails. Without an MEL, you have two options: (1) repair the compass, or (2) have a mechanic placard it INOP and verify it's not on the forbidden list per 91.213(d). The compass can be deferred if properly placarded, but you cannot fly until that's done.

**Cram Mode:**  
ATOMATOFLAMES = VFR day required equipment. Compass required. Broken required equipment = no fly without MEL/placard.

**Reference:** 14 CFR 91.205(b), 14 CFR 91.213

## QUESTION 22: Inoperative Equipment - Flaps Indicator

**Topic:** Inoperative Equipment - Non-Required Equipment  
**Airports:** KDVT (Phoenix Deer Valley) → KPRC (Prescott)  
**Aircraft:** Cessna 172

**Scenario:**  
You're planning a cross-country from Deer Valley (KDVT) to Prescott (KPRC). During runup, the electric flaps position indicator is stuck at "10 degrees" even when you move flaps to full down. The flaps physically work fine - you can see them extending - but the cockpit gauge doesn't move.

The POH doesn't list the flaps indicator as required. The plane has no MEL. You can verify flap position visually and there are mechanical detents for each setting.

**Question:** Can you make this flight?

**MODEL ANSWER:**  
No. Even though the flaps indicator isn't required equipment, 91.205(b) says all installed instruments must be operative unless properly placarded inop. Without an MEL, I need a mechanic to placard it INOP first.

**Trap Reasoning:**  
"The flaps indicator isn't required and the flaps work - I can fly"

**Why This Matters:**  
14 CFR 91.205(b) states: "No person may operate a civil aircraft with inoperative instruments or equipment installed" unless specific conditions are met. The flaps position indicator isn't required for VFR flight, but since it's installed, it must either work OR be properly deactivated per 91.213(d). You need a mechanic to placard it INOP, verify it's not on the forbidden list (it's not), and deactivate it if possible. Once properly placarded, you can fly using visual verification and mechanical detents - but you need that placard first.

**Cram Mode:**  
Installed equipment must work OR be placarded inop per 91.213, even if not "required." Get mechanic placard first.

**Reference:** 14 CFR 91.205(b), 14 CFR 91.213(d)

## QUESTION 23: Inoperative Equipment - Inop Sticker from Last Week

**Topic:** Inoperative Equipment - Proper Deactivation  
**Airports:** KSAC (Sacramento Executive) → KMER (Merced)  
**Aircraft:** Cessna 172

**Scenario:**  
You're renting a Cessna 172 for a cross-country from Sacramento (KSAC) to Merced (KMER). During preflight, you notice an "INOP" sticker on the ADF (Automatic Direction Finder). The plane has no MEL.

The dispatcher says, "Yeah, that ADF broke last week. We put the sticker on it. It's not required for VFR anyway, so we're good to rent it out."

You check the logbook - no entry about the ADF being deactivated. The INOP sticker is just tape with "INOP" written in marker.

**Question:** Can you make this flight?

**MODEL ANSWER:**  
No. While ADF isn't required for VFR, 91.213(d) requires a certificated mechanic to verify the equipment can be deferred and make a logbook entry. A homemade sticker without logbook entry isn't proper deactivation.

**Trap Reasoning:**  
"There's an INOP sticker and ADF isn't required - that's all you need"

**Why This Matters:**  
14 CFR 91.213(d) allows deferral of inoperative equipment only if: (1) not required by regulation, type certificate, or AD, (2) not on the forbidden list, (3) placard placed near the instrument, and (4) maintenance recorded in the aircraft logbook. The ADF is not required for VFR and not on the forbidden list, so it can legally be deferred. However, proper deferral requires an A&P mechanic to verify this, install a proper placard, and make a logbook entry describing the inoperative equipment and date. A homemade tape sticker without a logbook entry doesn't meet the regulatory requirements.

**Cram Mode:**  
INOP equipment needs A&P verification + logbook entry + proper placard. Homemade sticker without logbook = not legal.

**Reference:** 14 CFR 91.213(d)

## QUESTION 24: Inoperative Equipment - Electrical System Failure

**Topic:** Inoperative Equipment - System Failures  
**Airports:** KRHV (San Jose) → KWVI (Watsonville)  
**Aircraft:** Cessna 152

**Scenario:**  
You're planning a VFR day flight from San Jose (KRHV) to Watsonville (KWVI) - about 25 miles. During engine start, the ammeter shows discharge and the battery warning light is on. The engine runs, but the alternator isn't charging.

Required instruments work (engine-powered, not electrical). You have 30-45 minutes of battery. The flight is 20 minutes. The plane has no MEL.

You figure you can make it before the battery dies.

**Question:** Can you make this flight?

**MODEL ANSWER:**  
No. Under 14 CFR 91.7, I cannot fly an aircraft in an unairworthy condition. Starting a flight with a known electrical system failure creates an unsafe condition. Get the alternator fixed first.

**Trap Reasoning:**  
"I have enough battery for 30 minutes and the flight is 20 minutes - I can make it"

**Why This Matters:**  
14 CFR 91.7(a) states: "No person may operate a civil aircraft unless it is in an airworthy condition," and the PIC is directly responsible for determining airworthiness. An alternator failure during flight is an emergency you manage, but deliberately starting a flight with a known dead alternator means you're choosing to fly an unairworthy aircraft. If the battery dies en route, you lose radios (can't communicate with tower), transponder (ATC can't see you), and any electrical systems. Losing communications in Class D airspace is a violation. Get the alternator repaired before flying.

**Cram Mode:**  
91.7 requires aircraft to be airworthy. Failed alternator = unairworthy. Can't legally start flight with known system failure.

**Reference:** 14 CFR 91.7

## QUESTION 25: Inoperative Equipment - GPS Navigator

**Topic:** Inoperative Equipment - Non-Required Navigation Equipment  
**Airports:** KBOI (Boise) → KTWF (Twin Falls)  
**Aircraft:** Cessna 172 with Garmin GTN 650

**Scenario:**  
You're planning a VFR cross-country from Boise (KBOI) to Twin Falls (KTWF). The plane has a Garmin GTN 650 GPS that you normally use. During preflight, the GPS won't turn on - completely dead.

The plane has working VOR receivers, and you have paper charts. The route has VOR coverage and good visual landmarks. You're comfortable with VORs and pilotage. The plane has no MEL.

Your instructor asks, "Is the GPS required equipment?"

**Question:** Can you make this flight?

**MODEL ANSWER:**  
Yes, if the GPS is properly placarded INOP. GPS isn't required for VFR under 91.205. But since it's installed and broken, I need it placarded inoperative per 91.213 before departure.

**Trap Reasoning:**  
"GPS isn't required for VFR - I can just ignore it and use VORs instead"

**Why This Matters:**  
GPS is not required equipment for VFR flight per 14 CFR 91.205(b), but since it's installed in this aircraft, 91.205(b) requires it to either work OR be properly placarded inoperative. Without an MEL, you must follow 91.213(d) procedures: verify the GPS isn't required (correct), verify it's not on the forbidden list (correct), have a mechanic placard it INOP, and make a logbook entry. Once properly placarded, you can navigate using VORs, pilotage, and dead reckoning - but verify you're proficient with non-GPS navigation before launching.

**Cram Mode:**  
GPS not required for VFR but must be placarded INOP if broken. Get A&P placard + logbook entry per 91.213(d).

**Reference:** 14 CFR 91.205(b), 14 CFR 91.213(d)

## QUESTION 26: Inoperative Equipment - Fuel Quantity Gauges

**Topic:** Inoperative Equipment - Forbidden List  
**Airports:** KFFZ (Falcon Field) → KIWA (Phoenix-Mesa Gateway)  
**Aircraft:** Cessna 172

**Scenario:**  
You're planning a short flight from Falcon Field (KFFZ) to Phoenix-Mesa Gateway (KIWA) - about 15 miles. During preflight, you notice the left fuel quantity gauge is stuck on empty, even though you visually verified the tank is full during preflight.

The right fuel gauge works correctly. You can see both tanks are full by looking at them, and you'll visually check fuel level before each flight. The plane has no MEL.

Your instructor says, "Just placard it INOP and go - you can verify fuel visually."

**Question:** Can you make this flight if you placard the left fuel gauge INOP?

**MODEL ANSWER:**  
No. Fuel quantity gauges are on the forbidden list in 14 CFR 91.213(d)(2)(ii). They cannot be placarded inoperative - they must be repaired before flight. Get the gauge fixed.

**Trap Reasoning:**  
"I can visually check fuel and the other gauge works - one broken gauge is fine if placarded"

**Why This Matters:**  
14 CFR 91.213(d)(2) lists equipment that CANNOT be deferred even if not required for the current flight - these items must be repaired before flight. Fuel quantity indicators are specifically on this forbidden list because they're required by 14 CFR 91.205(b) for all flights. Even though you can visually check fuel levels and the right gauge works, you cannot legally fly with an inoperative fuel gauge until it's repaired. The forbidden list exists to prevent pilots from deferring critical safety equipment.

**Cram Mode:**  
Fuel gauges on forbidden list per 91.213 - cannot be placarded INOP. Must repair before flight.

**Reference:** 14 CFR 91.213(d)(2)(ii), 14 CFR 91.205(b)

## QUESTION 27: Inoperative Equipment - Second Radio Failure

**Topic:** Inoperative Equipment - Minimum Equipment  
**Airports:** KDVT (Deer Valley) → KGYR (Goodyear)  
**Aircraft:** Cessna 172 with two radios

**Scenario:**  
You're planning a VFR flight from Deer Valley (KDVT) to Goodyear (KGYR). The aircraft has two communication radios. During preflight, you discover COM 2 is inoperative and has been placarded INOP with a proper logbook entry from last week.

Today, during runup, COM 1 stops working completely. You now have no working radios. Both airports are Class D (towered). The weather is severe clear VFR. You're 5 miles from Goodyear.

You remember that you can enter Class D without a radio if it fails in flight. You figure you can just depart with both radios inop and land at Goodyear.

**Question:** Can you depart and fly to Goodyear?

**MODEL ANSWER:**  
No. Under 14 CFR 91.205(b), a two-way radio is required for VFR flight in Class D airspace. I cannot legally depart Deer Valley's Class D with no working radios. Radio failure in flight is different - that's an emergency.

**Trap Reasoning:**  
"Radio failure in flight lets you land Class D without comms - same thing applies for takeoff"

**Why This Matters:**  
14 CFR 91.205(b) requires a two-way radio for operations in Class B, C, D, or E airspace where two-way communication is required. Departing Deer Valley (Class D) requires a working radio. The exception for radio failure applies only when the radio fails DURING flight - it's an emergency procedure that allows you to safely land. You cannot deliberately start a flight with no radio intending to use the "radio failure" procedures. That's not an emergency - that's a regulatory violation. Get COM 1 repaired or tow the aircraft to a maintenance facility.

**Cram Mode:**  
Two-way radio required for Class B/C/D operations per 91.205. Can't deliberately depart with no radio. Radio failure exception only applies in flight.

**Reference:** 14 CFR 91.205(b), 14 CFR 91.129(c)

## QUESTION 28: Inoperative Equipment - Engine Gauge Failure

**Topic:** Inoperative Equipment - Critical vs Non-Critical  
**Airports:** KSEE (San Diego Gillespie) local  
**Aircraft:** Cessna 172

**Scenario:**  
You're planning a local flight from Gillespie Field (KSEE). During engine start, you notice the oil temperature gauge isn't working - it stays at zero even after the engine warms up. The oil pressure gauge works correctly and shows normal pressure.

The POH lists the oil temperature gauge as part of the required instruments. The plane has no MEL. You have a digital engine monitor (EDM) that shows oil temperature correctly - it's reading 180°F and climbing normally.

Your CFI says, "The EDM shows oil temp - the gauge is redundant. Placard it and go."

**Question:** Can you make this flight?

**MODEL ANSWER:**  
No. The POH lists the oil temperature gauge as required, which means it's required by the aircraft's type certificate. Under 91.213(d)(1), equipment required by the aircraft's type certificate cannot be deferred. The gauge must be repaired.

**Trap Reasoning:**  
"The digital engine monitor shows oil temperature - the gauge is redundant backup"

**Why This Matters:**  
14 CFR 91.213(d)(1) states that equipment required by regulation, the aircraft's type certificate, or ADs cannot be deferred - even with proper placarding. If the POH lists an instrument as required, it's part of the type certificate equipment list and must be operative. The EDM is supplemental equipment, not a substitute for required instruments. Even if the EDM provides the same information, it doesn't replace the required gauge per the type certificate. The gauge must be repaired before you can legally fly.

**Cram Mode:**  
Equipment required by POH/type certificate cannot be deferred per 91.213. Must repair before flight, even with backup instruments.

**Reference:** 14 CFR 91.213(d)(1)

## QUESTION 29: Inoperative Equipment - ELT Battery Expiration

**Topic:** Inoperative Equipment - ELT Requirements  
**Airports:** KSDL (Scottsdale) → KPRC (Prescott)  
**Aircraft:** Cessna 172

**Scenario:**  
You're planning a cross-country from Scottsdale (KSDL) to Prescott (KPRC). During preflight, you check the ELT (Emergency Locator Transmitter) and notice the battery expired 3 months ago according to the sticker on the unit.

The ELT itself is installed and appears functional - you test it briefly and it transmits. The battery just needs replacement. The plane has no MEL.

Your friend says, "ELTs are only required for hire operations and overwater flights. You're flying VFR cross-country - just go."

**Question:** Can you make this flight?

**MODEL ANSWER:**  
No. Under 14 CFR 91.207, ELTs are required for most aircraft, and the ELT battery must be replaced when 50% of useful life expires or after 1 hour of cumulative use. An expired battery means the ELT isn't airworthy. Get the battery replaced.

**Trap Reasoning:**  
"ELTs are only required for charter operations - private VFR flights don't need them"

**Why This Matters:**  
14 CFR 91.207 requires ELTs on most aircraft (with exceptions for training within 50nm, ag operations, and a few others). Your cross-country flight doesn't qualify for any exception. The regulation also requires the battery to be replaced (or recharged if rechargeable) when it reaches 50% of useful life or after 1 hour of cumulative use, whichever comes first. An expired battery makes the ELT non-functional in an emergency. While the ELT might transmit during your brief test, a 3-month-expired battery won't last long enough for rescue teams to locate you after a crash. Replace the battery before flying.

**Cram Mode:**  
ELT required for most operations per 91.207. Battery must be replaced when expired or after 50% useful life. Can't fly with expired ELT battery.

## QUESTION 30: Inoperative Equipment - Multiple INOP Items (Clock)

**Topic:** Inoperative Equipment - Multiple Inop Items  
**Airports:** KCHD (Chandler) → KSDL (Scottsdale)  
**Aircraft:** Cessna 172

**Scenario:**  
You're planning a short VFR day flight from Chandler (KCHD) to Scottsdale (KSDL) - about 10 miles. During preflight, you notice three items are placarded INOP with proper logbook entries:

1. ADF (Automatic Direction Finder) - not required for VFR
2. DME (Distance Measuring Equipment) - not required for VFR
3. Clock - required per 91.205(b) but placarded last week

The plane has no MEL. You have your watch and phone for time. Everything else works perfectly.

**Question:** Can you make this flight?

**MODEL ANSWER:**  
No. The clock is required VFR day equipment per 14 CFR 91.205(b). While ADF and DME can legally be deferred, the clock cannot be placarded inoperative - it's on the forbidden list because it's required equipment.

**Trap Reasoning:**  
"The clock was properly placarded with a logbook entry - I can use my watch"

**Why This Matters:**  
14 CFR 91.205(b) requires a "clock displaying hours, minutes, and seconds with a sweep-second pointer or digital presentation" for VFR flight. This is part of the required equipment (the first "T" in ATOMATOFLAMES). Even though the mechanic placarded it properly, clocks are required equipment and cannot be deferred - they must be repaired. Your watch and phone are not installed aircraft instruments and don't satisfy the requirement. The ADF and DME placards are fine (not required for VFR), but the clock placard is invalid. Get the clock fixed before flying.

**Cram Mode:**  
Clock required per 91.205 (ATOMATOFLAMES). Watch/phone don't count. Required equipment can't be placarded - must repair.

**Reference:** 14 CFR 91.205(b), 14 CFR 91.213(d)(2)

## QUESTION 31: Required Inspections - Annual Expiration

**Topic:** Inspections - Annual Inspection  
**Airports:** KAPA (Centennial) local  
**Aircraft:** Cessna 172

**Scenario:**  
You're planning a local flight from Centennial (KAPA). During preflight, you check the aircraft logbooks. The last annual inspection was completed on January 15, 2025. Today is January 20, 2026.

The aircraft has been flying regularly. There's a 100-hour inspection from 3 weeks ago (the aircraft is used for flight training). Everything else is current.

The flight school dispatcher says, "We have 5 days left on the annual - it's good until January 31, 2026 since annuals are valid for 12 calendar months."

**Question:** Can you make this flight?

**MODEL ANSWER:**  
Yes. Under 14 CFR 91.409(a), an annual inspection is valid for 12 **calendar** months. An annual completed on January 15, 2025 is valid through **January 31, 2026**. On January 20, 2026, the annual is still current, so the aircraft is legal to fly (assuming no other issues).

**Trap Reasoning:**  
"Annual inspections are good for 12 months from the date, so January 15, 2025 + 12 months = January 15, 2026"

**Why This Matters:**  
This is a calendar-month counting trap. “12 calendar months” means the inspection is valid through the **last day of the month** 12 months later, not exactly 365 days. If you can’t count calendar months correctly, you’ll ground airplanes that are legal—or worse, fly airplanes that are actually out of inspection.

**Cram Mode:**  
Annual inspection valid 12 calendar months: inspection in January 2025 is good through Jan 31, 2026. Calendar months end on the last day of the month.

**Reference:** 14 CFR 91.409(a)

## QUESTION 32: Required Inspections - 100-Hour for Rental

**Topic:** Inspections - 100-Hour Requirement  
**Airports:** KSDL (Scottsdale) → KIWA (Phoenix-Mesa Gateway)  
**Aircraft:** Cessna 172

**Scenario:**  
You're planning to rent a Cessna 172 for a personal flight from Scottsdale (KSDL) to Phoenix-Mesa Gateway (KIWA). You're a private pilot flying for personal reasons, not for hire or flight training.

The aircraft logbooks show the last 100-hour inspection was 103 flight hours ago. The tach shows this accurately. The annual inspection is current (completed 6 months ago).

The flight school dispatcher says, "100-hour inspections are only required for hire operations. Since you're renting it for personal use, you don't need a 100-hour - just an annual."

**Question:** Can you make this flight?

**MODEL ANSWER:**  
Yes, for this specific flight as described (personal VFR, no instruction). 14 CFR 91.409(b) applies to operations **carrying persons for hire** and to **flight instruction for hire** when the instructor provides the aircraft. A private rental flight isn’t automatically “carrying a person for hire” just because money changes hands for the aircraft. With a current annual, this flight can be legal even if the aircraft is beyond 100 hours — but the aircraft cannot be used for operations that *do* trigger 91.409(b) until it gets the 100-hour inspection.

**Trap Reasoning:**  
"I'm not using it commercially - I'm just renting for personal reasons, so 100-hour doesn't apply"

**Why This Matters:**  
This question tests the exact scope of 91.409(b). The 100-hour requirement is tied to specific *types of operation* (carrying persons for hire / instruction for hire), not simply “someone paid money somewhere.” In real life, many schools maintain 100-hour compliance across the fleet for simplicity and safety, but on a checkride you need to state the regulation accurately and then distinguish **legal** from **policy/safety**.

**Cram Mode:**  
100-hour applies to carrying persons for hire and to instruction for hire (when the instructor provides the aircraft). Rental alone doesn’t automatically trigger it; annual still matters for legality.

**Reference:** 14 CFR 91.409(b)

## QUESTION 33: Required Inspections - Transponder/Altimeter Check

**Topic:** Inspections - Transponder Certification  
**Airports:** KLAS (Las Vegas) → KPHX (Phoenix)  
**Aircraft:** Cessna 172

**Scenario:**  
You're planning a VFR flight from Las Vegas (KLAS) to Phoenix (KPHX). Both airports are under the Mode C veil (within 30nm of Class B primary airport). You'll be using flight following and squawking a transponder code.

During preflight document review, you notice the last transponder/encoder certification was completed on January 10, 2024. Today is February 7, 2026 - just over 2 years later. The annual inspection is current.

Your passenger says, "Transponder checks are only required for IFR flight. We're VFR - we're good."

**Question:** Can you make this flight?

**MODEL ANSWER:**  
No. Under 14 CFR 91.413, transponder/encoder certification is required every 24 calendar months for any operation in airspace requiring a transponder. Both airports are in Mode C veils, which require transponders. The check expired January 31, 2026.

**Trap Reasoning:**  
"Transponder certification is only required for IFR operations - VFR doesn't need it"

**Why This Matters:**  
14 CFR 91.413 requires transponder and encoder testing/inspection every 24 calendar months for operations in airspace where transponders are required. Mode C veils (within 30nm of Class B airports) require transponders per 14 CFR 91.215. The inspection done January 10, 2024 is valid through the last day of the 24th month - January 31, 2026. Today (February 7, 2026) is past expiration. You cannot operate in Mode C veil airspace until the transponder/encoder is recertified. Your options: get the certification done, or route around both Mode C veils (unlikely to be practical for this trip).

**Cram Mode:**  
Transponder/encoder cert required every 24 calendar months per 91.413. Required for any airspace needing transponder (Mode C veil, Class B/C, above 10K, etc).

**Reference:** 14 CFR 91.413, 14 CFR 91.215

## QUESTION 34: Weight & Balance - Missing Passenger Weight

**Topic:** Weight & Balance - Calculation Accuracy  
**Airports:** Ksdl (Scottsdale) → KPGA (Page)  
**Aircraft:** Cessna 172

**Scenario:**  
You're planning a cross-country from Scottsdale (KSDL) to Page (KPGA) with three passengers. During weight and balance calculations, you ask each passenger their weight:

- Passenger 1: "About 200 pounds"
- Passenger 2: "Maybe 180 or so"
- Passenger 3: "I don't want to say - just use 170"

You add their stated weights (200 + 180 + 170 = 550 lbs) plus your weight (185 lbs), baggage (60 lbs), and fuel. The result shows you're 50 lbs under max gross weight and within CG limits.

Your CFI asks, "Did you account for actual passenger weights, or what they told you?"

**Question:** Is your weight and balance calculation valid?

**MODEL ANSWER:**  
No. Under 14 CFR 91.103, I must determine the aircraft is within weight and balance limits before flight. Using estimated or potentially inaccurate passenger weights creates an unsafe condition. I need actual weights.

**Trap Reasoning:**  
"Passengers told me their weights - that's good enough for the calculation"

**Why This Matters:**  
14 CFR 91.103 requires pilots to become familiar with "all available information" before flight, including weight and balance calculations. People often underestimate their weight by 10-30 pounds. If all three passengers are heavier than they claimed (a common scenario), you could be significantly over gross weight without knowing it. The consequences: reduced climb performance, longer takeoff roll, reduced maneuverability, potential structural damage, and an unsafe flight. You must either weigh passengers (ideal), use FAA standard weights with winter clothing allowances, or use conservative estimates. Accepting vague estimates like "about 200" or "maybe 180" doesn't meet the requirement for accurate weight and balance.

**Cram Mode:**  
W&B calculations must use actual weights, not passenger estimates. People underestimate weight by 10-30 lbs. Weigh passengers or use conservative FAA standard weights.

**Reference:** 14 CFR 91.103, 14 CFR 91.9

## QUESTION 35: Weight & Balance - CG Within Range But Close

**Topic:** Weight & Balance - CG Limits and Safety  
**Airports:** KFXE (Fort Lauderdale) → KFPR (St. Lucie)  
**Aircraft:** Cessna 172

**Scenario:**  
You're planning a flight from Fort Lauderdale (KFXE) to St. Lucie (KFPR) with full fuel and two heavy passengers in the front seats (you and a 240-lb passenger). No rear passengers, and baggage area is empty.

Your weight and balance calculation shows:
- Takeoff weight: 2,295 lbs (5 lbs under max gross of 2,300 lbs)
- CG: 35.2 inches (forward limit is 35.0 inches, aft limit is 47.3 inches)

You're 0.2 inches inside the forward CG limit - technically legal. The weather is calm, and it's a short flight.

**Question:** Is this flight legal and safe?

**MODEL ANSWER:**  
Legal yes, but questionable safety decision. I'm only 0.2 inches from the forward CG limit. Under 14 CFR 91.9, I cannot exceed CG limits, but being this close creates handling issues. I should reconsider loading.

**Trap Reasoning:**  
"Weight and balance is within limits - if it's legal, it's safe"

**Why This Matters:**  
14 CFR 91.9 requires operating within weight and CG limits in the POH. You're technically legal (0.2 inches inside forward limit), but being this close to the limit creates real handling issues: heavy elevator forces, difficulty flaring for landing, nose-wheel damage risk, reduced stall margin, and limited elevator authority. POH limits include safety margins, but operating at the extreme edges uses up those margins. Consider redistributing weight (move baggage forward if you have any rear baggage, or reduce fuel slightly and refuel at destination) or declining the flight if you can't safely load the aircraft. Legal doesn't always mean smart.

**Cram Mode:**  
Must operate within W&B limits per 91.9. Legal ≠ always safe. Near CG limits = reduced handling margins. Consider redistributing weight.

## QUESTION 36: Weight & Balance - Fuel Burn and CG Shift

**Topic:** Weight & Balance - In-Flight CG Changes  
**Airports:** KTUS (Tucson) → KABQ (Albuquerque)  
**Aircraft:** Cessna 172

**Scenario:**  
You're planning a 2.5-hour cross-country from Tucson (KTUS) to Albuquerque (KABQ). You complete your weight and balance calculations for takeoff with full fuel (53 gallons) and one passenger in the right front seat.

Takeoff W&B:
- Weight: 2,280 lbs (20 lbs under max gross)
- CG: 46.8 inches (well within limits: 35.0 - 47.3 inches)

You'll burn approximately 24 gallons during the flight. The fuel tanks are located at station 48 (behind the CG). Your passenger asks, "Do we need to check weight and balance for landing, or just takeoff?"

**Are your takeoff calculations sufficient, or do you need to calculate landing W&B?**

**MODEL ANSWER:**  
I need to calculate landing weight and balance. Burning fuel moves CG forward. With fuel at station 48 (behind current CG of 46.8), I'll lose weight aft of CG, shifting it forward toward the limit of 35.0 inches.

**Trap Reasoning:**  
"If I'm legal at takeoff with the most weight, I'll definitely be legal at landing with less weight"

**Why This Matters:**  
Fuel location matters for CG shifts. In most Cessnas, fuel tanks are behind the CG range, so burning fuel shifts CG forward. Your takeoff CG is 46.8 (near aft limit of 47.3), but burning 24 gallons (144 lbs) from station 48 will shift CG significantly forward. You could violate the forward CG limit at landing even though you were legal at takeoff. Calculate both takeoff and landing W&B, and if landing CG approaches forward limit, consider reducing fuel load or repositioning weight. The POH may have a specific chart for CG shift due to fuel burn.

**Cram Mode:**  
Fuel behind CG: burning fuel shifts CG forward. Must calculate both takeoff and landing W&B to ensure limits not exceeded.

**Reference:** 14 CFR 91.9, POH Section 6

## QUESTION 37: Weight & Balance - Ballast Requirement

**Topic:** Weight & Balance - Light Weight Operations  
**Airports:** KDVT (Deer Valley) local  
**Aircraft:** Cessna 172

**Scenario:**  
You're a 140-lb pilot planning a solo pattern work session at Deer Valley (KDVT). The aircraft has minimal fuel (15 gallons for local pattern work) and no baggage. You complete your weight and balance:

- Weight: 1,950 lbs (350 lbs under max gross)
- CG: 34.2 inches (forward limit is 35.0 inches)

Your CG is 0.8 inches forward of the forward limit. The POH has a note: "Ballast may be required for solo operations with minimal fuel." There's a 50-lb sandbag in the hangar labeled "BALLAST - Place in baggage area when required."

**Is it safe to depart, or what action should you take?**

**MODEL ANSWER:**  
I cannot depart - my CG is forward of the 35.0-inch limit. Under 14 CFR 91.9, I must operate within CG limits. I need to add the 50-lb ballast to the baggage area to shift CG aft.

**Trap Reasoning:**  
"I'm 350 pounds under gross weight - there's plenty of safety margin even if CG is slightly forward"

**Why This Matters:**  
Operating outside CG limits is illegal per 14 CFR 91.9, regardless of how much weight margin you have. Forward CG creates heavy elevator forces, difficulty flaring, potential nose-wheel damage, and reduced elevator authority at slow speeds. The POH specifically notes ballast may be required for solo flight with low fuel because light weight in the front (just the pilot) with minimal fuel (also forward of CG in many aircraft) creates an excessively forward CG. Add the 50-lb ballast to the baggage area (aft of CG), recalculate, and verify you're within limits before departing. Ballast must be secured and noted on the W&B sheet.

**Cram Mode:**  
CG limits are hard stops per 91.9. Can't fly outside limits regardless of weight. Solo + low fuel = often needs ballast in baggage area.

## QUESTION 38: Weight & Balance - Baggage Area Overload

**Topic:** Weight & Balance - Compartment Limits  
**Airports:** KPHX (Phoenix) → KFLG (Flagstaff)  
**Aircraft:** Cessna 172

**Scenario:**  
You're flying from Phoenix (KPHX) to Flagstaff (KFLG) with three passengers and camping gear. Each passenger has a 30-lb bag (90 lbs total). You have a 40-lb cooler. Total baggage: 130 lbs.

Your weight and balance calculation:
- Total weight: 2,240 lbs (60 lbs under max gross of 2,300 lbs)
- CG: 42.5 inches (well within 35.0 - 47.3 range)

The POH baggage area placard says: "BAGGAGE AREA: 120 LBS MAX." You figure since you're 60 lbs under gross weight, the extra 10 lbs in the baggage area is fine - the aircraft can handle it.

**Does this loading meet regulatory requirements?**

**MODEL ANSWER:**  
No. The baggage area limit is 120 lbs maximum. I have 130 lbs - 10 lbs over the structural limit. Under 14 CFR 91.9, I cannot exceed limitations in the POH. I need to remove 10 lbs of baggage.

**Trap Reasoning:**  
"I'm 60 pounds under gross weight, so I can exceed the baggage limit by 10 pounds"

**Why This Matters:**  
14 CFR 91.9 requires compliance with operating limitations in the POH. Baggage area limits are structural, not just weight-and-balance numbers. The 120-lb baggage limit exists because the baggage compartment floor is only stressed for 120 lbs - exceeding it risks structural damage to the airframe. Being under gross weight doesn't give you permission to exceed compartment limits. These are separate requirements. Redistribute weight (move lighter items to the cabin area if there's room and it doesn't affect CG), reduce baggage, or make two trips. Exceeding structural limits can cause floor damage, failure in turbulence, or even collapse.

**Cram Mode:**  
Baggage area limits are structural, not weight. Can't exceed compartment limits even if under gross. POH limits are hard stops per 91.9.

**Reference:** 14 CFR 91.9, POH Section 2

## QUESTION 39: Weight & Balance - Moment Calculation Error

**Topic:** Weight & Balance - Calculation Accuracy  
**Airports:** KSNA (Orange County) → KSAN (San Diego)  
**Aircraft:** Cessna 172

**Scenario:**  
You're planning a flight from Orange County (KSNA) to San Diego (KSAN) with two passengers and baggage. You complete your weight and balance using the "moment/1000" method from the POH.

Your calculations:
- Empty weight moment: 101.2 (from W&B sheet)
- Pilot + front passenger (350 lbs @ station 37): moment = 350 × 37 = 12,950 ÷ 1000 = 12.95
- Rear passengers (380 lbs @ station 73): moment = 380 × 73 = 27,740 ÷ 1000 = 27.74
- Baggage (50 lbs @ station 95): moment = 50 × 95 = 4,750 ÷ 1000 = 4.75
- Fuel (40 gal = 240 lbs @ station 48): moment = 240 × 48 = 11,520 ÷ 1000 = 11.52

Total moment: 101.2 + 12.95 + 27.74 + 4.75 + 11.52 = 158.16
Total weight: 2,270 lbs
CG: 158.16 ÷ 2.27 = 69.67 inches

The POH shows aft CG limit is 47.3 inches. Your calculation shows 69.67 inches - way beyond limits. But you triple-checked the math and it's correct. Your CFI glances at your work and says, "You made a common mistake."

**What's wrong with your calculation?**

**MODEL ANSWER:**  
The arithmetic isn’t the problem — the **input units are**. A C172 CG can’t be ~69 inches on the standard POH CG range, so at least one value you pulled from the W&B sheet is in the wrong column/units (most commonly: you grabbed an **arm** and treated it like a **moment**, or you mixed **moment/100**, **moment/1000**, or a different datum).

To fix it, I’d re-check the aircraft’s current W&B sheet and make sure I’m using a consistent set:
- If the POH worksheet uses **moment/1000**, use moments in that same unit for *every* line item (including empty weight).
- Compute CG as: `CG = (Total Moment/1000 × 1000) ÷ Total Weight` (equivalently, `CG = Total Moment ÷ Total Weight` if Total Moment is in full inch-pounds).

**Trap Reasoning:**  
"I followed the POH worksheet exactly and double-checked my arithmetic"

**Why This Matters:**  
W&B failures are often **unit mistakes**, not “math mistakes.” The DPE wants to see you sanity-check outputs: if a computed CG is wildly outside the POH envelope, you don’t rationalize it — you back up and verify you’re using the correct *current* empty weight/arm/moment values and the correct unit convention for that POH worksheet.

**Cram Mode:**  
If the CG result is absurd, you probably mixed **arm vs moment** or **moment scaling**. Re-check the empty weight data and keep units consistent end-to-end.

## QUESTION 40: Weight & Balance - Amended Weight After Equipment Install

**Topic:** Weight & Balance - Equipment Changes  
**Airports:** KSDL (Scottsdale) → KSEZ (Sedona)  
**Aircraft:** Cessna 172

**Scenario:**  
You're planning a flight from Scottsdale (KSDL) to Sedona (KSEZ). During preflight, you notice the aircraft recently had a Garmin GTN 650 GPS installed. The work was completed 2 weeks ago. You check the logbook - there's a maintenance entry for the GPS installation signed off by an A&P.

You pull out the aircraft weight and balance sheet from the POH - it shows the last weight and balance was done 3 years ago, before the GPS installation. The GPS weighs approximately 4 lbs and is located at station 40 (in the panel).

You calculate weight and balance using the old W&B data plus your passengers, fuel, and baggage. Everything looks legal.

**Is your weight and balance calculation valid for this flight?**

**MODEL ANSWER:**  
No. Under 14 CFR 91.417, major alterations require an updated weight and balance. The GPS installation should have included a new W&B calculation. I cannot use the old W&B data - I need the amended data sheet before flight.

**Trap Reasoning:**  
"The GPS only weighs 4 pounds and it's in the panel - I can just add 4 lbs to my calculation"

**Why This Matters:**  
14 CFR 91.417 requires maintenance records for major alterations, including weight and balance revisions when equipment is added or removed. Installing panel-mount avionics is a major alteration that changes the aircraft's empty weight and moment. While 4 lbs seems minor, it's at station 40 (forward), which affects CG. Additionally, the GPS installation may have removed old equipment, and there may have been wiring, trays, or antennas added that you don't know about. The maintenance entry should reference a new weight and balance calculation. Check with the shop that did the installation - they must provide an amended weight and balance data sheet. You cannot legally fly using outdated W&B data after equipment changes.

**Cram Mode:**  
Equipment changes require amended W&B per 91.417. Can't use old W&B data after avionics install. Get updated W&B sheet from maintenance.

**Reference:** 14 CFR 91.417, 14 CFR 43.9

## QUESTION 41: Weight & Balance - Performance Chart Assumptions

**Topic:** Weight & Balance - Performance Impact  
**Airports:** KASE (Aspen) departure  
**Aircraft:** Cessna 172

**Scenario:**  
You're departing Aspen (KASE) - field elevation 7,820 feet MSL. Temperature is 75°F. Your weight and balance shows you're at max gross weight (2,300 lbs) with CG at 44.5 inches (within limits).

You consult the POH takeoff performance chart. The chart shows takeoff distance at gross weight, 8,000 ft density altitude is approximately 2,100 feet ground roll. The runway is 8,000 feet long, so you have plenty of margin.

Your CFI asks, "What weight did the POH use for those performance calculations?" You check the chart notes - it says "Performance data based on 2,300 lbs max gross weight."

**Will your takeoff performance match the POH chart?**

**MODEL ANSWER:**  
Yes, I'm at 2,300 lbs which matches the chart. But I should verify CG is in the range the chart assumes and check for any notes about CG effects on performance. Forward CG can increase takeoff distance.

**Trap Reasoning:**  
"I'm at exactly the weight the chart specifies - my performance will exactly match the numbers"

**Why This Matters:**  
POH performance charts assume specific conditions: weight, CG, temperature, altitude, wind, runway surface, and pilot technique. While you're at the correct weight (2,300 lbs), other factors matter. Your CG of 44.5 is toward the aft end of the range - this can actually improve takeoff performance slightly (less elevator drag). However, forward CG increases drag and can increase takeoff distance beyond chart values. More importantly, the chart assumes professional test pilot technique, new aircraft condition, and no headwind (unless specified). Your actual performance will likely be worse than the chart. Add safety margins - consider 1.5x the chart distance as a conservative personal minimum, especially at high density altitude airports like Aspen.

**Cram Mode:**  
POH performance charts assume specific conditions. Actual performance usually worse than chart. Use safety margins - especially high altitude.

## QUESTION 42: Airworthiness Directives - Compliance Status Unknown

**Topic:** Airworthiness Directives - Compliance Verification  
**Airports:** KSDL (Scottsdale) → KIWA (Phoenix-Mesa Gateway)  
**Aircraft:** Cessna 172N (1979)

**Scenario:**  
You're planning to rent a 1979 Cessna 172N for a cross-country from Scottsdale (KSDL) to Phoenix-Mesa Gateway (KIWA). During preflight document review, you search the logbooks for Airworthiness Directive (AD) compliance.

You find entries for several ADs from 10+ years ago, but nothing recent. You search online and find that the FAA issued a new AD three months ago for Cessna 172 seat rails (AD 2025-23-15) - recurring inspection required every 100 hours.

You ask the flight school dispatcher about it. They say, "I'm not sure if that AD applies to this aircraft. The mechanic handles all that stuff. The annual was done 4 months ago, so we should be good."

**Should you fly this aircraft?**

**MODEL ANSWER:**  
No. Under 14 CFR 91.403, I'm responsible for maintaining the aircraft in an airworthy condition, which includes AD compliance. I cannot verify AD 2025-23-15 compliance. I need documentation before flying.

**Trap Reasoning:**  
"The annual inspection was done recently - the mechanic would have caught any ADs"

**Why This Matters:**  
14 CFR 39.3 requires compliance with all applicable ADs. As PIC, you're responsible for verifying AD compliance per 14 CFR 91.403, even in rental aircraft. The annual was 4 months ago, but this AD was issued 3 months ago - after the annual. If the AD requires recurring 100-hour inspections and hasn't been addressed, the aircraft may be unairworthy. You need to verify: (1) Does this AD apply to this specific aircraft (serial number check)? (2) Has the initial compliance been completed? (3) When is the next inspection due? Don't accept "the mechanic handles it" - you need to see documentation. Request the AD compliance log or don't fly the aircraft.

**Cram Mode:**  
PIC responsible for AD compliance per 91.403 and 39.3. Must verify compliance before flight. Can't assume annual caught everything if AD issued after annual.

## QUESTION 43: Airworthiness Directives - One-Time vs Recurring

**Topic:** Airworthiness Directives - Compliance Types  
**Airports:** KCHD (Chandler) local  
**Aircraft:** Cessna 172

**Scenario:**  
You're planning a local flight from Chandler (KCHD). You review the aircraft logbooks and find two AD entries:

1. AD 2023-08-12 (Fuel selector valve inspection) - entry dated 14 months ago states "AD complied with, no defects found"
2. AD 2024-15-03 (Alternator belt inspection) - entry dated 6 months ago states "AD complied with, recurring inspection required every 100 flight hours"

The aircraft has flown 120 hours since the alternator belt AD compliance 6 months ago. The tach shows this clearly. The annual inspection is current (done 3 months ago).

**Is the aircraft airworthy for your flight today?**

**MODEL ANSWER:**  
No. AD 2024-15-03 requires recurring inspections every 100 hours. The aircraft has flown 120 hours since the last compliance - it's 20 hours overdue. The aircraft is not airworthy until the recurring AD inspection is completed.

**Trap Reasoning:**  
"The annual inspection was done 3 months ago - the mechanic would have done the AD inspection during the annual"

**Why This Matters:**  
Airworthiness Directives come in two types: one-time compliance and recurring compliance. AD 2023-08-12 was one-time - once complied with, it's done forever. AD 2024-15-03 is recurring every 100 flight hours - it must be repeated at the specified interval. The aircraft flew 120 hours since last compliance (6 months ago), making it 20 hours overdue. The annual inspection 3 months ago should have caught this, but you can't assume it did without verification. Even if the mechanic did the AD during the annual, you need to verify it's documented. ADs must be complied with per 14 CFR 39.3 - no grace period, no exceptions. Get the recurring AD inspection done before flying.

**Cram Mode:**  
ADs can be one-time or recurring. Recurring ADs must be repeated at specified intervals. No grace period - overdue AD = unairworthy aircraft.

**Reference:** 14 CFR 39.3, 14 CFR 91.403

## QUESTION 44: Weather - METAR Age and Validity

**Topic:** Weather - METAR Currency  
**Airports:** KBOI (Boise) → KTWF (Twin Falls)  
**Aircraft:** Cessna 172

**Scenario:**  
You're planning a VFR cross-country from Boise (KBOI) to Twin Falls (KTWF). It's 1545Z (8:45 AM local). You check weather and find:

KBOI METAR: "KBOI 1453Z 34008KT 10SM FEW050 SCT120 15/08 A3012"
KTWF METAR: "KTWF 1355Z 02005KT 10SM SCT060 BKN100 14/07 A3015"

Boise's METAR is 52 minutes old. Twin Falls' METAR is 1 hour 50 minutes old. Both show good VFR conditions. The flight will take 50 minutes. You're departing in 15 minutes.

Your passenger asks, "Is the Twin Falls weather still good if that METAR is almost 2 hours old?"

**Does the old METAR affect your go/no-go decision?**

**MODEL ANSWER:**  
The Twin Falls METAR is concerning because it's nearly 2 hours old. METARs are issued hourly, so a METAR that old means either the station is down or there's a reporting issue. I should call Flight Service or check other sources before launching.

**Trap Reasoning:**  
"The METAR shows VFR conditions - as long as it's VFR, the age doesn't matter"

**Why This Matters:**  
METARs are issued hourly at 55 minutes past the hour (1353Z, 1453Z, 1553Z, etc.). A METAR from 1355Z when it's now 1545Z means you're missing the 1455Z observation - nearly 2 hours of data gap. Weather can change dramatically in 2 hours, especially with fronts, thunderstorms, or rapidly changing conditions. While the old METAR showed VFR, you have no current data. 14 CFR 91.103 requires you to become familiar with all available information before flight. Options: (1) Call Flight Service for a current observation, (2) Check nearby airport METARs and trends, (3) Check AWOS/ASOS phone number for real-time conditions, (4) Delay departure until current METAR is available. Don't launch on 2-hour-old weather data.

**Cram Mode:**  
METARs issued hourly at :53-:55 past hour. Missing METAR = data gap. Don't launch on 2-hour-old weather - get current obs.

## QUESTION 45: Weather - TAF Valid Times

**Topic:** Weather - TAF Interpretation  
**Airports:** KPHX (Phoenix) → KABQ (Albuquerque)  
**Aircraft:** Cessna 172

**Scenario:**  
You're planning a morning departure from Phoenix (KPHX) to Albuquerque (KABQ). Current time is 1400Z (7:00 AM local). Your planned departure is in 1 hour (1500Z). Flight time is 2 hours, landing at 1700Z.

You pull up the Albuquerque TAF:

KABQ 121120Z 1212/1312 18008KT P6SM FEW250  
FM121800 21012KT P6SM SCT100  
FM130000 25015G25KT 5SM -SHRA BKN040 OVC080

The TAF was issued at 1120Z today (the 12th). You'll be landing at 1700Z (5:00 PM local). Your passenger asks, "What weather should we expect at landing?"

**What weather does the TAF predict for your arrival?**

**MODEL ANSWER:**  
The TAF shows P6SM scattered clouds at 10,000 feet for my arrival at 1700Z. The "FM121800" group means "from the 12th at 1800Z" (11:00 AM local) - winds 210 at 12 knots, visibility greater than 6 miles, scattered at 10,000.

**Trap Reasoning:**  
"The TAF shows rain and low ceilings - the weather will be bad when I land"

**Why This Matters:**  
TAF valid times use a specific format: YYDDHH/YYDDHH (year-day-hour). This TAF is valid from the 12th at 1200Z through the 13th at 1200Z (24 hours). The groups are: (1) 1212/1312 baseline, (2) FM121800 = from 12th at 1800Z, (3) FM130000 = from 13th at 0000Z (midnight). You're landing at 1700Z on the 12th - that's between 1200Z and 1800Z, so you use the first group OR the second group... actually 1700Z is before 1800Z, so you'd use the baseline forecast. Wait - "FM121800" means FROM 1800Z onward. So at 1700Z, the baseline 1212/1312 forecast applies: 180 at 8 knots, vis >6SM, few clouds at 25,000. The rain (FM130000) doesn't start until midnight - 7 hours after your landing.

**Cram Mode:**  
TAF groups use YYDDHH format. FM = from that time onward. Find which time group covers your operation. Don't misread the forecast period.

## QUESTION 46: Weather - VFR Minimums Day vs Night

**Topic:** Weather - Cloud Clearance Requirements  
**Airports:** KLAX (Los Angeles) → KSAN (San Diego)  
**Aircraft:** Cessna 172

**Scenario:**  
You're planning a flight from Los Angeles (LAX) to San Diego (SAN). Both airports are Class B, but you're planning to fly at 4,500 feet VFR underneath the Class B shelves, staying in Class E airspace the entire route.

Current conditions: scattered clouds at 3,500 feet, broken clouds at 6,000 feet, visibility 5 miles in haze. You'll be flying between the cloud layers at 4,500 feet.

Your original plan was to depart at 2:00 PM, but you got delayed. Now it's 5:30 PM, sunset is at 5:45 PM, and you won't land until 7:00 PM (1 hour after sunset - officially "night").

**Do the VFR weather minimums change between your planned departure and actual operation?**

**MODEL ANSWER:**  
Yes. During the day in Class E below 10,000 feet, I need 3 miles visibility and 500 below/1,000 above/2,000 horizontal from clouds. At night in the same airspace, I need the exact same minimums - they don't change for Class E.

**Trap Reasoning:**  
"Night VFR requires higher cloud clearances than day VFR"

**Why This Matters:**  
This is a trick question - VFR cloud clearance and visibility minimums in Class E airspace are the same day and night per 14 CFR 91.155. The minimums (3-152: 3 miles vis, 1,000 above, 500 below, 2,000 horizontal) apply 24/7 in Class E below 10,000 feet MSL. However, your current conditions might not be legal: clouds at 3,500 feet, you're at 4,500 feet (1,000 above - legal), but broken clouds at 6,000 feet means you're only 1,500 feet below the broken layer. You need 1,000 feet above - you have that. But can you legally fly between layers? The broken layer at 6,000 means less than 5/8 sky coverage at that altitude, but broken means 5/8 to 7/8 coverage - you need to ensure you can maintain cloud clearances. The real issue: 5 miles visibility is legal (need 3), but flying between layers at night is poor ADM.

**Cram Mode:**  
VFR minimums in Class E are same day/night: 3 miles vis, 500 below/1,000 above/2,000 horizontal. Don't confuse with Class G surface areas.

## QUESTION 47: Weather - Special VFR at Night

**Topic:** Weather - Special VFR Limitations  
**Airports:** KSNA (Orange County) → KBUR (Burbank)  
**Aircraft:** Cessna 172

**Scenario:**  
You're planning an evening flight from Orange County (KSNA - Class C) to Burbank (KBUR - Class C). Departure is planned for 7:00 PM, after sunset (6:15 PM).

Current weather at both airports: 2 miles visibility in haze, clear of clouds, no reported ceiling. This is below VFR minimums (need 3 miles in Class C), but you're instrument rated and the aircraft is IFR equipped.

Your friend suggests, "Just request Special VFR clearance from both towers. You're clear of clouds and have 2 miles - that's legal for Special VFR."

**Can you conduct this flight under Special VFR?**

**MODEL ANSWER:**  
Yes, if ATC issues a Special VFR clearance and you can remain clear of clouds with at least 1 SM visibility. At **night**, 14 CFR 91.157 also requires that the pilot be instrument rated and the aircraft be IFR-equipped. Since you are instrument rated and the aircraft is IFR-equipped, Special VFR at night can be legal. Separate from legality, it may be poor risk management; if you’re instrument rated, filing IFR is often the safer choice in low visibility.

**Trap Reasoning:**  
"Special VFR is not allowed at night under any circumstances"

**Why This Matters:**  
14 CFR 91.157 is a “legal but risky” trap. Special VFR is not a weather *recommendation* — it’s a clearance that allows operation below basic VFR mins in certain controlled surface areas. The rule has extra requirements at night (instrument-rated pilot + IFR-equipped aircraft). A DPE expects you to state the rule correctly and then make a conservative decision: low visibility at night is a classic CFIT/disorientation setup, and if you have an instrument rating, IFR is usually the correct tool.

**Cram Mode:**  
Special VFR at night requires: instrument rating + IFR-equipped aircraft + clear of clouds + 1SM vis + ATC clearance. Legal but high-risk.

## QUESTION 48: Weather - AIRMET vs SIGMET

**Topic:** Weather - Advisory Interpretation  
**Airports:** KDEN (Denver) → KGJT (Grand Junction)  
**Aircraft:** Cessna 172

**Scenario:**  
You're planning a morning VFR flight from Denver (KDEN) to Grand Junction (KGJT) - over the Rockies at 11,500 feet. You check weather briefing and see:

"AIRMET SIERRA for IFR and mountain obscuration over Colorado Rockies. Conditions expected to continue through 18Z."

"SIGMET NOVEMBER 2 valid until 1600Z. Severe turbulence below FL200 due to mountain wave. Pilot reports moderate to severe turbulence 8,000-14,000 MSL."

Current conditions are VFR at both airports. Your planned altitude (11,500 feet) puts you in the SIGMET area. You've flown in light turbulence before and it wasn't a problem.

**Should these advisories affect your go/no-go decision?**

**MODEL ANSWER:**  
Yes, absolutely. The SIGMET warns of severe turbulence in my planned altitude range (11,500 feet is between 8,000-14,000 MSL). SIGMETs indicate hazardous conditions. This is a no-go for a VFR Cessna 172. I should delay or cancel.

**Trap Reasoning:**  
"I've flown in light turbulence before - turbulence is just uncomfortable, not dangerous"

**Why This Matters:**  
AIRMETs warn of weather that may be hazardous to small aircraft (moderate icing, turbulence, IFR conditions). SIGMETs warn of weather hazardous to ALL aircraft (severe icing, severe turbulence, thunderstorms, etc.). The SIGMET for severe turbulence below FL200 is extremely serious. "Severe turbulence" means large, abrupt changes in altitude and attitude - it can cause structural damage and loss of control. Pilot reports of "moderate to severe" in your exact altitude range means other pilots experienced this recently. Mountain wave turbulence can create downdrafts exceeding the Cessna 172's climb capability - you could be forced into terrain. SIGMETs are non-discretionary for VFR flights - you should not fly in SIGMET areas in a light aircraft. Delay until the SIGMET expires (1600Z) or cancel the flight.

**Cram Mode:**  
AIRMET = hazardous to small aircraft. SIGMET = hazardous to ALL aircraft. Don't fly VFR in SIGMET areas. Severe turbulence can cause structural damage.

## QUESTION 49: Weather - Freezing Level and Carburetor Ice

**Topic:** Weather - Icing Conditions  
**Airports:** KSEA (Seattle) → KPDX (Portland)  
**Aircraft:** Cessna 172 (carbureted)

**Scenario:**  
You're planning a VFR flight from Seattle (KSEA) to Portland (KPDX) at 5,500 feet. Current conditions: temperature at sea level is 45°F, dewpoint 42°F. The Area Forecast shows freezing level at 8,000 feet.

You'll be flying at 5,500 feet where the temperature will be approximately 32°F (assuming standard lapse rate of 2°C per 1,000 feet). No precipitation is forecast, but there are scattered clouds at 4,000 feet and broken clouds at 7,000 feet.

Your passenger asks, "Since we're below the freezing level at 8,000 feet, we don't need to worry about ice, right?"

**Are icing conditions a concern for this flight?**

**MODEL ANSWER:**  
Yes. Carburetor ice can form even when outside air temperature is above freezing. With OAT around 32°F and high humidity (dewpoint 42°F at sea level), carburetor ice is very likely. I need to monitor carb temp and use carb heat as needed.

**Trap Reasoning:**  
"The freezing level is 8,000 feet - I'm at 5,500 feet, so no ice"

**Why This Matters:**  
The freezing level refers to structural icing (ice forming on the aircraft's exterior). Carburetor ice is completely different - it can form when outside air temperature is between 20°F and 70°F with visible moisture or high humidity. The Venturi effect in the carburetor causes temperature to drop 60-70°F, and moisture in the air freezes inside the carburetor throat, restricting airflow. Your conditions are perfect for carb ice: OAT around 32°F, high humidity (dewpoint spread of only 3°F at sea level), and you'll be flying near clouds (moisture). Monitor for signs of carb ice (rough running, RPM drop), use carb heat preventively during descent and reduced power ops, and be prepared to apply full carb heat if ice forms. This is a very real threat in carbureted engines.

**Cram Mode:**  
Freezing level = structural ice. Carburetor ice = different threat, forms 20°F-70°F with moisture. High humidity + temps near freezing = high carb ice risk.

## QUESTION 50: Weather - Density Altitude and Performance

**Topic:** Weather - Performance Planning  
**Airports:** KTVL (Lake Tahoe) departure  
**Aircraft:** Cessna 172

**Scenario:**  
You're departing Lake Tahoe Airport (KTVL) - field elevation 6,264 feet MSL. Current conditions: temperature 85°F, altimeter 29.92. Runway 18 is 7,000 feet long. You're solo with half fuel (26 gallons).

You calculate density altitude using the Koch chart:
- Pressure altitude: 6,264 feet (altimeter is standard, so PA = field elevation)
- Temperature: 85°F = 29°C
- ISA at 6,264 feet = 15°C - (2°C × 6.264) = 15 - 12.5 = 2.5°C
- Temperature is 29 - 2.5 = 26.5°C above standard
- Density altitude: approximately 9,000 feet

Your POH shows takeoff ground roll at 9,000 feet DA is 1,600 feet. You have 7,000 feet of runway - more than 4x the required distance.

**Is the runway length adequate for a safe departure?**

**MODEL ANSWER:**  
Maybe - I need to check total distance to clear 50-foot obstacle, not just ground roll. High density altitude dramatically increases total takeoff distance. The POH might show 3,000+ feet to clear obstacles at 9,000 DA. I need to verify before departing.

**Trap Reasoning:**  
"Ground roll is 1,600 feet and I have 7,000 feet - that's plenty of safety margin"

**Why This Matters:**  
POH performance charts show two distances: ground roll (distance to liftoff) and total distance to clear 50-foot obstacle. At high density altitude, the total distance can be 2-3x the ground roll because climb performance is severely degraded. Your ground roll might be 1,600 feet, but total distance to clear 50 feet could be 3,500+ feet at 9,000 DA. If there are obstacles at the departure end (trees, terrain), 7,000 feet might not be enough. Additionally, POH numbers assume new aircraft, professional test pilot technique, no wind, and paved surface. High DA also reduces climb rate - you might only climb at 200-300 FPM. Check the full performance data, add safety margins (1.5-2x), verify obstacle clearance, and consider departing early morning when temps are cooler for better performance.

**Cram Mode:**  
High density altitude = reduced performance. Check total distance to clear obstacles, not just ground roll. Ground roll × 2-3 = total distance at high DA.
