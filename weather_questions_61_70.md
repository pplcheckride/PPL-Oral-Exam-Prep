## QUESTION 61: Weather - TAF Interpretation (TEMPO/PROB)

**Topic:** Weather - Forecast Risk vs “Current VFR”  
**Airports:** KPDX (Portland) → KSLE (Salem)  
**Aircraft:** Cessna 172

**Scenario:**  
You’re planning a short VFR hop from Portland (KPDX) to Salem (KSLE) for a stage check that must start at 10:30 AM local. Your instructor is waiting at KSLE, and you’ve already rescheduled once.

Current METARs are VFR at both airports (10SM, SCT/BKN above 3,500). But the KSLE TAF includes:

- `TEMPO 1517/1520 2SM -RA BR BKN008`  
- `PROB30 1518/1522 2SM TSRA BKN020CB`

Your estimated arrival is 18Z—right in the middle of the TEMPO/PROB window.

**How should you interpret this TAF for a VFR go/no-go decision?**

**MODEL ANSWER:**  
I should plan for the *worst-case* conditions during my arrival window, not the “nice” parts. A TEMPO for 2SM and an 800-foot ceiling would make KSLE effectively IFR for me, and the PROB30 TSRA adds convective risk. Even if it’s VFR right now, forecast deterioration at my ETA is a strong reason to delay or cancel. If I go, I need a solid alternate plan: divert options, a hard turn-around point, and no “pressing in” if ceilings start dropping.

**Trap Reasoning:**  
“TEMPO and PROB30 are low-confidence, so I can ignore them as long as it’s VFR right now.”

**Why This Matters:**  
14 CFR 91.103 requires you to become familiar with *weather reports and forecasts* for the flight. A VFR launch into a forecast window that includes IFR ceilings/visibilities is a classic setup for VFR-into-IMC. TEMPO means “expected fluctuations” for less than an hour at a time (but they can repeat), and PROB indicates non-trivial risk of hazardous weather. If the risk window overlaps your ETA, treat it as operationally real—especially when the consequence is getting trapped above a lowering ceiling with mist/rain reducing visibility. The legal question isn’t “Is it VFR at departure?”—the practical question is “Will I still be VFR with safe outs when I get there?”

**Cram Mode:**  
If TEMPO/PROB overlaps your ETA, plan for the *bad* part. VFR now doesn’t matter if forecast at arrival is IFR-ish.

## QUESTION 62: Weather - AIRMET Sierra (Mountain Obscuration)

**Topic:** Weather - Mountain Obscuration Risk for VFR  
**Airports:** KBJC (Rocky Mountain Metro) → KEGE (Eagle County)  
**Aircraft:** Cessna 172

**Scenario:**  
You’re planning a daytime VFR flight from the Denver area (KBJC) to Eagle (KEGE) for a weekend trip. You’re not instrument rated. The surface weather near Denver is VFR, and you can see blue sky to the west from the ramp.

During your briefing you see an **AIRMET Sierra** along your route for **mountain obscuration** due to clouds and light snow showers over the Continental Divide, valid for the next 6 hours.

Your passenger says, “But it’s VFR here—can’t we just go and see how it looks when we get closer?”

**What does an AIRMET Sierra for mountain obscuration mean for a VFR mountain crossing decision?**

**MODEL ANSWER:**  
For VFR in the mountains, an AIRMET Sierra for mountain obscuration is a major no-go flag. Even if the departure area is VFR, the obscuration can hide ridgelines and passes and destroy my ability to maintain required terrain clearance and VFR cloud clearances. “Going to take a look” can trap me in narrowing valleys with lowering ceilings. I should delay, reroute away from the obscured terrain, or cancel.

**Trap Reasoning:**  
“AIRMETs are mainly for IFR pilots; as long as I stay VFR I’m fine.”

**Why This Matters:**  
Mountain obscuration is one of the highest-risk weather setups for VFR pilots because the hazard is *terrain you can’t see*, not just “a lower ceiling.” Clouds, snow showers, and blowing snow can erase horizon and hide ridgelines, leading to controlled flight into terrain (CFIT) and VFR-into-IMC. AIRMETs are issued for weather that can impact light aircraft—exactly your category. 14 CFR 91.103 requires evaluating forecasts along the route, not just at the endpoints, and your outs in mountain terrain are limited. The safe decision is almost always to avoid crossing the affected mountains until the AIRMET clears.

**Cram Mode:**  
AIRMET Sierra + mountains = don’t “take a look.” Obscuration hides terrain and passes—VFR outs disappear fast.

## QUESTION 63: Weather - LLWS / Gust Front / Microburst Risk

**Topic:** Weather - Wind Shear Decision Triggers  
**Airports:** KMCO (Orlando) arrival  
**Aircraft:** Cessna 172

**Scenario:**  
You’re returning to Orlando (KMCO) late afternoon to make a family event. The ATIS includes:

- Winds 240 at 12, gusting 28  
- “LLWS advisory in effect”  
- Thunderstorms reported in the area, moving east

On final you notice the windsock snapping, and you see a dark rain shaft about 10–15 miles off the approach end. ATC hasn’t said “microburst alert,” but several jets ahead are going around.

Your passenger says, “We’re almost there—just land it.”

**What’s your decision, and what specific wind-shear cues are you looking for?**

**MODEL ANSWER:**  
I should strongly consider a go-around or divert and wait it out. LLWS advisories plus gusty winds and nearby convection are classic microburst/gust-front conditions. Cues: sudden airspeed changes, rapid sink or ballooning, big wind shifts, increasing tailwind on short final, and reports of aircraft going around. In a 172, a sudden loss of headwind can eliminate my safety margin fast. I’m not obligated to “try it once.” The safe move is to break off early and get away from the shear environment.

**Trap Reasoning:**  
“If ATC doesn’t say ‘microburst,’ it’s just gusty winds. I can handle it if I stay fast.”

**Why This Matters:**  
Wind shear is dangerous because it can change faster than you can correct—especially near the ground. Microbursts and gust fronts can exist without a dramatic-looking storm over the field, and the worst shear can be outside the rain shaft. “Adding a little airspeed” is not a cure for a sudden headwind-to-tailwind transition at 200 feet AGL. Good ADM is recognizing the combination of cues (LLWS advisory, gusts, nearby convection, multiple go-arounds) and choosing to avoid the environment entirely.

**Cram Mode:**  
LLWS + gusts + nearby storms + go-arounds = treat as microburst risk. Don’t “try one” in a trainer—go around/divert early.

## QUESTION 64: Weather - NEXRAD Latency (The “Green Gap” Trap)

**Topic:** Weather - Datalink Radar Limitations  
**Airports:** KHOU (Houston Hobby) area  
**Aircraft:** Cessna 172

**Scenario:**  
You’re VFR with flight following near Houston. You’re using EFB radar (NEXRAD mosaic) and see a line of light-to-moderate returns with a tempting “gap” that looks wide enough to slip through. The EFB shows the radar image is **6–8 minutes old**, and you notice your groundspeed is 110 knots.

ATC says, “Deviation approved—advise when able direct.”

Your passenger says, “There’s a hole right there—just go through it.”

**Is it smart to use that EFB NEXRAD gap tactically, and what’s the safer technique?**

**MODEL ANSWER:**  
No—EFB NEXRAD is not reliable for close-in tactical threading. With 6–8 minutes of latency (plus processing/relay time), the “gap” could have moved, filled in, or become the strongest part of the line by the time I get there. The safer technique is strategic avoidance: stay well clear of the entire convective area, use large separation, and never plan to penetrate between cells based solely on delayed mosaic radar.

**Trap Reasoning:**  
“Radar is radar. If it shows a gap, it’s real right now.”

**Why This Matters:**  
NEXRAD mosaics are excellent for big-picture planning but dangerous when used like real-time, onboard weather radar. The age stamp is not the whole story: collection, processing, uplink, and display all add delay. At 110 knots, you can travel more than 12 miles in 6 minutes—meaning you can fly from “clear” into the core before your display catches up. The safest VFR thunderstorm strategy is conservative standoff, not precision threading.

**Cram Mode:**  
Datalink NEXRAD is delayed—great for strategy, terrible for “threading holes.” If you’re using it tactically, you’re already behind.

## QUESTION 65: Weather - Freezing Level + “Between Layers” Icing Trap

**Topic:** Weather - Icing Risk Without an “Icing Forecast”  
**Airports:** KROA (Roanoke) → KLYH (Lynchburg)  
**Aircraft:** Cessna 172 (not approved for known icing)

**Scenario:**  
You’re planning a short daytime VFR flight at 7,500 feet MSL. The freezing level along route is reported around **6,000 feet**. Cloud layers are **BKN060** with **OVC090**. No AIRMET Zulu is currently out, and the area forecast doesn’t explicitly mention icing.

Your friend says, “No icing AIRMET means you’re fine. Just stay between the layers and you’ll be VFR.”

**What’s the icing risk here, and how do you make a safer plan?**

**MODEL ANSWER:**  
Even without an icing AIRMET, the risk is real anytime you combine **visible moisture** with **subfreezing temperatures**. At 7,500 (above the freezing level), any cloud penetration—or even skimming ragged edges—can produce ice quickly in a non-FIKI aircraft. A safer plan is to stay below the freezing level (if terrain/MEFs allow), delay until temps warm, or cancel if I can’t guarantee staying well clear of clouds while maintaining safe terrain clearance and VFR minimums.

**Trap Reasoning:**  
“Icing only matters if an AIRMET says ‘icing,’ and it only happens inside clouds.”

**Why This Matters:**  
Icing is a physics problem: supercooled liquid water + airframe + below-freezing temps. Forecast products can miss small-scale icing, and “no AIRMET” does not equal “no ice.” The “between layers” plan often fails when layers thicken, bases lower, tops rise, or the route forces you closer to the clouds than you expected. In a 172, even a small amount of ice can degrade climb, increase stall speed, and ruin visibility—fast. Good ADM is recognizing that “VFR between layers” at temperatures below 0°C is often one unplanned climb/descent away from a serious problem.

**Cram Mode:**  
No icing AIRMET ≠ no ice. Visible moisture + below 0°C = potential ice. “Between layers” is fragile—don’t bet a non-FIKI plane on it.

## QUESTION 66: Weather - Frontal Passage Timing (Trend Awareness)

**Topic:** Weather - Front Timing vs Get-There-Itis  
**Airports:** KSTL (St. Louis) → KCOU (Columbia, MO)  
**Aircraft:** Cessna 172

**Scenario:**  
You’re trying to make it home tonight. A cold front is forecast to move through your route area. The departure METAR is still VFR, but you notice:

- Pressure has been steadily falling the last few hours  
- Winds are increasing and starting to veer  
- The destination TAF shows a wind shift, lowering ceilings, and `-RA` after 02Z

Your planned arrival is 01:45Z—“just before” the forecast deterioration.

**What’s the risk with “beating the front,” and what decision rule would you use?**

**MODEL ANSWER:**  
The risk is the front arrives earlier or conditions deteriorate faster than the TAF suggests, trapping me with lowering ceilings/visibility near arrival. I’d use a hard rule: if the forecast trend shows deterioration near my ETA, I either depart early enough to arrive with a large buffer or I don’t go. I also set a “turn-back time” and require multiple viable alternates with improving weather, not just “maybe it stays VFR.”

**Trap Reasoning:**  
“TAFs are exact. If it says it goes down after 02Z, I’m safe if I arrive before 02Z.”

**Why This Matters:**  
Fronts don’t read TAFs. Timing errors happen, and the most dangerous period for a VFR pilot is the transition when ceilings lower and visibility degrades—especially near nightfall. “Just before” is not a safety margin. 14 CFR 91.103 requires considering forecasts and trends, not just a snapshot METAR. Good ADM is building buffer time, recognizing accelerating deterioration cues (falling pressure, increasing winds, thickening clouds), and avoiding the temptation to “sneak in.”

**Cram Mode:**  
“Beat the front” is a trap: trends can accelerate and timing shifts. If deterioration overlaps ETA, build buffer or don’t go.

## QUESTION 67: Weather - METAR Visibility Nuances (BR vs FG, VV)

**Topic:** Weather - Reading METARs Beyond “VFR/IFR”  
**Airports:** KOMA (Omaha) early morning departure  
**Aircraft:** Cessna 172

**Scenario:**  
You’re planning a sunrise departure. Two nearby airports are reporting:

- Airport A: `2SM BR OVC003 06/05`  
- Airport B: `1/2SM FG VV002 06/06`

Your friend says, “They both look ‘kinda foggy’—same thing.”

**What’s the operational difference between BR vs FG, and OVC003 vs VV002?**

**MODEL ANSWER:**  
BR (mist) is reduced visibility but generally not as restrictive as FG (fog). FG implies much lower visibility (often below 5/8 SM), and the temperature/dewpoint spread near zero supports persistent low vis. OVC003 is an overcast ceiling at 300 feet AGL. VV002 means vertical visibility 200 feet—an indefinite ceiling where the sky is obscured; conditions are typically worse and more limiting. Airport B is significantly worse and less predictable for VFR (and often for IFR departures/arrivals too).

**Trap Reasoning:**  
“OVC003 and VV002 are basically the same—both just mean ‘low clouds.’”

**Why This Matters:**  
A ceiling is only defined when you can see a cloud layer. When the sky is obscured (fog/heavy precip), the report switches to vertical visibility (VV), which often indicates truly poor conditions and low confidence about where you’ll break out. BR vs FG matters because it’s a cue about *severity and persistence*. Treating all “low and gray” reports as equivalent leads to bad decisions like launching into an environment where the ceiling/vis is not just low—it’s undefined and can easily go to zero. Even if you’re IFR-rated, you use these cues to decide whether conditions are improving or degrading.

**Cram Mode:**  
BR = mist (less severe). FG = fog (worse). OVC is a measured ceiling; VV means sky obscured/indefinite ceiling—often the nastiest.

## QUESTION 68: Weather - Anvil & Outflow Hazards (Storm “Not on My Route”)

**Topic:** Weather - Thunderstorm Indirect Hazards  
**Airports:** KICT (Wichita) departure  
**Aircraft:** Cessna 172

**Scenario:**  
It’s summer afternoon in Kansas. A thunderstorm cell is 25 miles north of the field and moving east—“not on your route.” The radar shows the core north of you, and the sky south looks mostly clear.

But you notice a large **anvil** spreading overhead, and surface winds at the airport have begun shifting and increasing quickly. Dust is visible in the distance.

Your friend says, “The storm is far away and moving away. Let’s go.”

**What weather hazard is developing, and what’s the correct decision?**

**MODEL ANSWER:**  
This looks like **outflow/gust-front** behavior from the thunderstorm. The hazard (strong wind shift, turbulence, possible microbursts) can extend well away from the rain core and can arrive before the storm itself. The correct decision is to delay—don’t depart into a rapidly changing wind environment with convective outflow.

**Trap Reasoning:**  
“If I’m not flying through the rain, the thunderstorm can’t affect me.”

**Why This Matters:**  
Thunderstorms are not “point hazards.” The outflow boundary can produce abrupt wind shifts, strong gusts, blowing dust, and low-level wind shear. That’s dangerous on takeoff and landing—exactly when you have the least margin. The anvil overhead is a clue that strong convection exists even if the rain shaft is off to the side. Good ADM is treating convective outflow like a moving hazard zone, not a stationary cloud you can “stay away from.”

**Cram Mode:**  
Storm core isn’t the whole threat. Outflow/gust fronts can hit far from the rain and wreck takeoff/landing margins. Anvil + wind shift = wait.

## QUESTION 69: Weather - Mountain Wave / Rotor Recognition

**Topic:** Weather - Severe Turbulence & Downdrafts  
**Airports:** KABQ (Albuquerque) → KSAF (Santa Fe)  
**Aircraft:** Cessna 172

**Scenario:**  
You’re planning a daytime VFR flight with a friend who’s new to small airplanes. Winds aloft forecast:

- 9,000 ft: 290 at 35 knots  
- 12,000 ft: 300 at 50 knots

You see smooth, lens-shaped clouds (lenticulars) near the mountains and ragged “rolling” clouds downwind. The surface winds at KSAF are gusty and variable.

Your passenger is nervous and asks if the ride will be smooth.

**What phenomenon is likely present, and how does it affect your route/altitude decision?**

**MODEL ANSWER:**  
This is a classic setup for **mountain wave** with possible **rotor turbulence** on the lee side. In a 172, that can mean severe turbulence, strong downdrafts, and difficulty maintaining altitude—especially near ridgelines and passes. I’d avoid the lee side, consider delaying until winds decrease, choose a route that minimizes terrain interaction, and keep a large terrain/altitude margin with a clear turn-around option.

**Trap Reasoning:**  
“If it’s VFR and I can see the mountains, turbulence is just ‘a few bumps.’”

**Why This Matters:**  
Mountain wave can produce vertical air movement that exceeds the climb capability of a light trainer, plus rotor can be violent and unpredictable. Lenticular clouds are a big visual clue that the atmosphere is organized into waves. “VFR” only tells you about visibility/ceilings—not the vertical winds and turbulence that can make the flight unsafe. Good ADM is recognizing the cues and not flying a low-powered airplane into an environment where terrain + strong winds aloft can pin you down.

**Cram Mode:**  
Lenticulars + strong winds aloft = mountain wave risk. Rotor on lee side can be brutal. VFR doesn’t mean smooth or safe.

## QUESTION 70: Weather - Personal Minimums (Applying a Framework)

**Topic:** Weather - Setting/Using Personal Minimums  
**Airports:** KCLT (Charlotte) → KAVL (Asheville)  
**Aircraft:** Cessna 172

**Scenario:**  
Your checkride is in 72 hours, and you’re feeling pressure to “stay sharp.” You plan a VFR training cross-country from Charlotte (KCLT) to Asheville (KAVL). The brief shows:

- Ceilings: 3,500–4,500 broken along route  
- Visibility: 6–8SM with light haze  
- Winds at KAVL: 240 at 14G22  
- Terrain rising near Asheville; potential mechanical turbulence with gusts

Legally, this might still be VFR, but it’s not a slam dunk for a student-level pilot.

**How would you apply personal minimums to make a go/no-go decision here?**

**MODEL ANSWER:**  
I’d use personal minimums that account for my experience, aircraft, environment, and mission pressure. For example: minimum ceiling 5,000 AGL enroute/3,000 AGL in mountains, minimum visibility 8SM, maximum steady wind/crosswind/gust spread limits, and stricter limits if I’m tired or it’s near night. If conditions are at or near my limits—especially with gusts and terrain—I delay, get dual instruction with a clear training objective, or choose a different route/time. The point is having the rule *before* I’m emotionally invested.

**Trap Reasoning:**  
“If it’s legal VFR, personal minimums are optional. I can ‘judge it in the moment.’”

**Why This Matters:**  
Weather-related accidents often start with a legal launch and end with a shrinking margin. Personal minimums protect you from your own optimism and external pressure (checkride timeline, passengers, schedules). A good framework forces you to consider: terrain, gusts, turbulence, alternates, and “what if it gets 20% worse.” It’s not about being timid—it’s about being consistent and disciplined so you don’t gradually normalize risk.

**Cram Mode:**  
Set personal minimums *before* you want the flight. If conditions are near the line—especially with terrain/gusts—don’t “see how it goes.”
